        <h2>Service Description</h2>
        <p>Fix Septic Now is a lead generation and service coordination platform that connects Texas homeowners with licensed septic service providers. We do not directly perform septic services.</p>

        <h2>No Guarantee of Service</h2>
        <p>While we strive to connect you with available service providers quickly, response times and availability may vary based on location, time of day, and demand.</p>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>Prices listed on our website are estimates only. Final pricing is determined by the service provider based on your specific situation and is agreed upon before work begins.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Fix Septic Now acts as a coordination platform. We are not liable for the quality, timeliness, or outcome of services performed by third-party providers.</p>

        <h2>Website Use</h2>
