  "aboutSection": "Katy sits at the western edge of the Houston metro where suburban development meets agricultural land, and that transition zone is full of properties that depend on private septic systems. Inside Katy city limits, many homes connect to municipal sewer, but the vast unincorporated areas stretching into Harris, Waller, and Fort Bend counties are almost entirely septic-dependent. If your address has a Katy zip code but sits outside city services, your wastewater system is your responsibility.\n\nThe defining challenge for septic systems in the Katy area is Beaumont clay. This dense, expansive soil type is notorious in Southeast Texas for its poor drainage characteristics. When it rains, Beaumont clay swells and becomes nearly impermeable. During dry spells, it shrinks and cracks, which can shift tank positions and fracture distribution pipes. Drain fields built in heavy clay need careful engineering, often requiring raised bed or mound systems to achieve adequate percolation rates.\n\nBecause the soil holds water rather than letting it pass through, Katy septic systems tend to work harder than systems in sandier regions. Effluent sits in the drain field longer, which accelerates biomat buildup on the trench walls. Left unchecked, this leads to drain field saturation, wet spots in the yard, and eventually complete system failure. Regular pumping and periodic inspections are the best defense against these issues.\n\nWe frequently see Katy homeowners dealing with slow drains that plumbers can't fix, foul odors near the tank or drain field, and standing water after moderate rain events. Many of these problems trace back to deferred maintenance or systems that were undersized for the household. Katy's rapid growth over the past two decades also means many homes were built with builder-grade systems that are now reaching the end of their expected lifespan. If your system is 15 to 20 years old, a professional inspection can tell you where things stand before an emergency forces your hand.",

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Katy?",
      "answer": "Septic pumping in Katy generally costs between $375 and $625. The heavy clay soil can make access and digging to locate lids more labor-intensive, which occasionally adds to the cost. A typical 1,000-gallon residential tank runs around $400 to $475. We always provide a clear price before starting so there are no surprises on your bill."

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Katy?",
      "answer": "Due to Katy's Beaumont clay soil and its poor drainage characteristics, we recommend pumping every two to three years for most households. The clay puts extra stress on drain fields by limiting how fast effluent can percolate, so keeping solid levels low in the tank is critical. Larger families or homes with garbage disposals should lean toward the shorter end of that range."
