  "aboutSection": "Palestine is the Anderson County seat, a city with a long history as a railroad hub and agricultural center that today serves as a gateway between the Blackland Prairie to the west and the deep Piney Woods to the east. The majority of properties outside Palestine's core municipal area rely on individual septic systems, from modest homes on the outskirts of town to sprawling rural properties along FM roads that wind through pine and hardwood forest.\n\nAnderson County's predominant soil type is sandy loam, the well-draining, organically rich soil typical of the East Texas timberlands. This soil is naturally suited to septic drain field operation because it allows water to percolate at a healthy rate while supporting the microbial communities that help treat effluent. Most conventional gravity-fed systems perform reliably in this ground when properly maintained.\n\nPalestine's geographic position creates some variation, though. Properties toward the western edge of the county, closer to the Blackland Prairie transition, may encounter pockets of heavier clay that drain more slowly. Near the Trinity River and its tributaries, lower elevations can see higher seasonal water tables, especially after heavy spring rains. These areas require systems designed with the fluctuating groundwater in mind.\n\nCommon problems we handle in Palestine include root intrusion from the pine and hardwood forests that define the landscape, deteriorating older tanks on properties built in the mid-20th century, and lift station pump failures on terrain that rolls more than flat. Many Anderson County systems are decades old and were installed when households used significantly less water than modern families do. These older systems may need upgrading or at minimum more frequent pumping to compensate for the higher load they now carry.",
  "whyChooseSection": "Anderson County spans the transition from prairie to Piney Woods, and we've worked properties across that full range. We know where the sandy loam runs deep and where clay pockets or low-lying terrain require a different approach. Palestine's older housing stock means many of the systems we service here are aging and need the kind of experienced evaluation that prevents small problems from becoming expensive ones. Our response times to Palestine are reliable, and 24/7 availability ensures no emergency goes unanswered. Licensed, insured, and equipped for any scope of work. Call Fix Septic Now at (936) 292-2926.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Palestine?",
      "answer": "Every three to five years for most Palestine homes on sandy loam. Properties near the western edge of Anderson County with heavier soil, or older systems with smaller tanks handling modern water usage, should lean toward the shorter end. The East Texas climate keeps bacterial activity high but also builds sludge. We can inspect your system and set the right schedule."
