  "aboutSection": "Tomball sits at a crossroads in northwest Harris County where suburban sprawl meets rural Texas. The city itself is compact, but the Tomball mailing address covers a broad stretch of unincorporated land where municipal sewer simply doesn't reach. Most homes outside city limits, and quite a few within the older parts of town, rely on private septic systems to handle their wastewater.\n\nThe sandy loam soil that predominates in the Tomball area is one of the more septic-friendly soil types in the greater Houston region. It offers solid percolation rates, meaning effluent moves through the drain field at a healthy pace and gets naturally filtered by the soil before reaching groundwater. This is good news for system longevity, but it doesn't make maintenance optional. Even in favorable soil, a neglected tank will eventually send solids into the drain field and clog things up.\n\nTomball's older neighborhoods, particularly those built in the 1970s and 1980s along streets near downtown, contain some of the most aged septic infrastructure in the area. Concrete tanks from that era are often cracked or corroding, and original clay distribution pipes may have collapsed or been infiltrated by tree roots. If you own one of these older Tomball properties, a thorough inspection is one of the best investments you can make.\n\nOn the newer side, the rapid residential development spreading from Tomball toward Spring, Magnolia, and Cypress has placed thousands of fresh septic systems in the ground over the past decade. Many of these use aerobic treatment units that require more regular maintenance than conventional systems, including quarterly inspections and chlorine tablet replenishment. Skipping that maintenance voids warranties and risks system failure. Whether your system is 40 years old or four years old, consistent service keeps it working the way it should.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Tomball?",
      "answer": "Tomball's sandy loam soil drains well, which means conventional systems often run efficiently on a three- to five-year pumping cycle. Homes with aerobic treatment units need quarterly maintenance checks in addition to periodic pumping. Larger households or properties with older, smaller tanks should pump more frequently. We'll evaluate your system and give you a custom recommendation."
