  "aboutSection": "Willis is a small Montgomery County town on I-45 between Conroe and Huntsville, surrounded by a large rural service area that extends east toward the Sam Houston National Forest and west toward Lake Conroe. Municipal sewer service is limited to a small footprint within city limits, which means the overwhelming majority of Willis-area properties operate on private septic systems. From lakefront homes to timber tracts to the newer subdivisions filling in along FM 1097, septic maintenance is a shared responsibility across the community.\n\nThe sandy loam soil that covers the Willis area provides generally favorable conditions for conventional drain fields. Percolation rates are good, and the soil structure supports natural filtration of effluent before it reaches the water table. This means standard gravity-fed systems tend to perform well here, and many older Willis properties have run reliably on simple conventional setups for decades.\n\nHowever, Willis-area properties near Lake Conroe face a distinct set of considerations. Lakefront and near-lake homes often contend with higher water tables, especially during wet seasons or when lake levels are elevated. High groundwater reduces the effective treatment zone in a drain field and can lead to surfacing effluent. Properties within the Lake Conroe watershed also carry additional responsibility for preventing contamination, since septic discharge that reaches the lake affects water quality for the entire region.\n\nCommon issues we encounter in Willis include aging systems on older rural properties where maintenance has been inconsistent, root intrusion from pine trees that thrive in the sandy soil, and undersized systems on properties where usage has increased over the years. We also see seasonal stress on systems during the summer months when Lake Conroe area homes see increased occupancy from visitors and renters, placing sudden demand on systems designed for smaller households.",

      "answer": "Most Willis-area septic pump-outs cost between $325 and $550. The sandy loam soil makes tank access relatively straightforward in most locations.

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Willis?",
      "answer": "Willis's sandy loam soil supports a three- to five-year pumping cycle for most residential systems. Lake Conroe area homes used as vacation rentals or with seasonal spikes in occupancy should pump more frequently, potentially every two to three years. Homes on well water have extra incentive to stay on schedule to protect their water source."
