  "aboutSection": "Forney's transformation over the past two decades has been remarkable. What was once a small farming community along the Highway 80 corridor is now a thriving suburb with a population exceeding 27,000 and new rooftops appearing constantly. Many of these newer developments, particularly those on the expanding edges of town, rely on septic systems because municipal sewer infrastructure hasn't kept pace with the rate of construction.\n\nLike much of Kaufman County, Forney sits squarely on blackland clay. This heavy, mineral-rich soil is productive for agriculture but presents ongoing challenges for septic systems. The clay's slow permeability means drain fields must work harder to process effluent, and during extended wet periods, saturation becomes a real risk. The soil's shrink-swell characteristics compound the issue by physically moving buried components, cracking tanks, and disrupting the grade of distribution lines over time.\n\nForney's rapid growth has created a unique dynamic: many of the septic systems here are relatively new and still under warranty or within their first maintenance cycle. That's actually an advantage, because establishing a proper pumping schedule from the start extends system life dramatically. New homeowners in Forney subdivisions sometimes don't realize they're on septic or underestimate the maintenance required, which can lead to problems within the first few years if the tank goes unpumped.\n\nIssues we see regularly in Forney include builder-grade systems that meet minimum requirements but are undersized for actual household water usage, drain field stress from the heavy clay's poor drainage, and occasional construction debris left in or near the system during the building process. Established properties closer to old Forney deal with the same aging-system concerns as any mature north Texas community: deteriorating tanks, root intrusion, and outdated designs. Regular professional maintenance is the best investment a Forney homeowner can make in their septic system.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Forney?",
      "answer": "Every two to three years is recommended for Forney homes on blackland clay. The clay limits drain field efficiency, which puts more burden on the tank. New homeowners should start their pumping schedule within the first three years, even if the system is brand new. We can set up a maintenance plan that protects your investment long-term."
