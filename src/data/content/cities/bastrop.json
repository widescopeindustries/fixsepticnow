  "aboutSection": "Bastrop is a Colorado River town in a county that stretches from the sandy post-oak savannah of the Lost Pines to the blackland prairie further west. It's a community that has grown steadily as Austin's influence expands eastward, but municipal sewer service remains limited to a compact area within city limits. The surrounding county, where most of the new residential development is happening, is almost entirely septic-dependent.\n\nWhat makes Bastrop County distinctive from a septic perspective is the Lost Pines sandy loam. This deep, well-drained soil is an isolated geological pocket that's more closely related to East Texas soils than to the clay and limestone found just a few miles away. For septic systems, this sand-dominant profile means excellent percolation rates and effective natural filtration. Conventional gravity drain fields perform reliably in this soil, and many older Bastrop properties have run on simple, well-designed systems for decades.\n\nThe flip side of great drainage is faster movement of effluent to groundwater. In sandy soil, a malfunctioning system can contaminate wells and nearby water sources more quickly than it would in tighter soils. This makes regular pumping and inspection not just good practice but an important safeguard for water quality, particularly on properties that rely on private wells.\n\nThe 2011 and 2015 wildfires that devastated portions of Bastrop County also left a lasting impact on septic infrastructure. Fire destroyed homes but often left underground septic components damaged in less obvious ways. Heat can warp PVC pipes, crack risers, and damage electrical components on aerobic systems. Properties that were rebuilt on existing septic infrastructure should have those systems professionally evaluated if that hasn't already happened.\n\nBastrop's Colorado River corridor introduces its own set of variables. Properties along the river and its tributary creeks deal with fluctuating water tables and occasional flooding that can overwhelm or damage septic systems. Homes in the floodplain need systems designed and maintained with these events in mind.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Bastrop?",
      "answer": "Bastrop's sandy loam drains efficiently, supporting a three- to five-year pumping cycle for most conventional systems. However, because sandy soil moves effluent to groundwater faster, properties with wells should consider pumping every two to three years as a precaution. Aerobic units need quarterly maintenance visits regardless of soil type."
