  "aboutSection": "Humble sits at a key junction in northeast Harris County where suburban Houston meets the piney woods of East Texas. The city and its surrounding unincorporated areas span a wide range of property types, from compact lots in established neighborhoods to multi-acre tracts along the San Jacinto River corridor. Many of these properties, especially those outside the reach of municipal utility districts, depend on private septic systems for wastewater management.\n\nThe clay loam soil found across the Humble area presents a moderate challenge for septic systems. It drains better than the pure Beaumont clay found further south, but it's substantially tighter than the sandy soils to the north. During periods of heavy rain, which are frequent in this part of Texas, clay loam can become saturated enough to significantly reduce drain field performance. The result is often standing water in the yard, slow-flushing toilets, or sewage odors near the tank.\n\nHumble's proximity to Lake Houston and the San Jacinto River system also means elevated water tables in many neighborhoods. Properties on lower ground or near tributary creeks face a higher risk of groundwater interfering with drain field operation. During flood events, which have hit the Humble area particularly hard in recent years, septic tanks can become buoyant or flooded, requiring professional assessment and often pumping before the system can return to normal function.\n\nOlder systems in the Humble area frequently show their age through deteriorating concrete baffles, corroded metal risers, and distribution pipes that have settled unevenly in the clay. We also see a pattern of septic issues in neighborhoods where sewer conversion was planned but never completed, leaving homeowners maintaining systems they assumed were temporary. Whatever condition your system is in, professional diagnosis is the first step toward a reliable solution.",
  "whyChooseSection": "Fix Septic Now knows the Humble area from the ground up, literally. We've worked the clay loam along Will Clayton and pumped tanks in Atascocita when Lake Houston was still receding. That kind of field experience means we diagnose problems accurately and recommend solutions that actually hold up in local conditions. We're available 24/7 because the San Jacinto doesn't care about business hours, and neither do septic emergencies. Our pricing is transparent, our work is thorough, and our crews treat every property with respect. Call (936) 292-2926 and see the difference local expertise makes.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Humble?",
      "answer": "Humble's clay loam soil doesn't drain as freely as sandier soils, so we typically recommend pumping every two to four years depending on household size and system condition. Properties near Lake Houston or in flood-prone areas may need more frequent service to keep systems performing reliably. An inspection can pinpoint the ideal schedule for your property."
