  "aboutSection": "Conroe has grown from a quiet East Texas timber town into one of the fastest-expanding cities in the Houston metro, and that growth has pushed residential development well beyond municipal sewer lines. Tens of thousands of Conroe-area properties rely on septic systems, from older homes along FM 1484 and FM 3083 to master-planned communities stretching toward The Woodlands and Willis.\n\nThe soil profile across Montgomery County plays a direct role in how well your septic system performs. Much of Conroe sits on sandy loam, which drains efficiently and is generally kind to conventional drain fields. However, pockets of heavy clay appear throughout the area, particularly south of town and near Lake Conroe, where water tables can run higher during wet seasons. Clay slows percolation, which means effluent doesn't filter through the soil as quickly. Over time, this leads to saturated drain fields, standing water in the yard, and slow drains inside the house.\n\nConroe's warm, humid climate accelerates biological activity inside the tank, which is usually a good thing for breaking down solids. But it also means grease and scum layers build up faster than homeowners expect, especially in households with garbage disposals or heavy kitchen use. Most Conroe properties benefit from pumping every three to four years, though homes on tighter clay soils or with smaller tanks may need service more often.\n\nCommon issues we see in Montgomery County include root intrusion from pine and oak trees growing into distribution lines, shifting soils that crack older concrete tanks, and drain field failure caused by compacted soil or vehicle traffic over the leach area. Flooding events, which Conroe has experienced repeatedly, can also overwhelm systems by raising groundwater above the drain field elevation. If you've noticed soggy patches in your yard, sewage odors, or gurgling drains, those are signs your system needs professional attention before a small problem turns into a costly one.",
  "whyChooseSection": "Choosing a septic company that actually knows Conroe makes a real difference.

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Conroe?",
      "answer": "Most Conroe septic pump-outs fall between $350 and $600, depending on tank size, depth, and accessibility. A standard 1,000-gallon tank on a residential property typically lands in the $375 to $450 range. Larger tanks or systems that haven't been pumped in many years may cost more due to additional labor and disposal fees. We provide upfront pricing before any work begins."

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Conroe?",
      "answer": "For most Conroe homes, every three to four years is a solid rule of thumb. Properties sitting on heavier clay soils, particularly south of town, may need pumping closer to every two to three years because slower drainage puts extra load on the system. Household size matters too. A family of five will fill a tank faster than a retired couple. We can inspect your system and recommend a schedule that fits your property."
