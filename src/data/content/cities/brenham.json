  "heroDescription": "Brenham is the heart of Washington County, a place known for bluebonnets, Blue Bell ice cream, and the kind of wide-open rural properties that run on septic systems. Fix Septic Now provides 24/7 septic pumping, repair, and installation throughout Brenham and Washington County. The sandy loam and clay soils in this rolling countryside create different drainage conditions from hilltop to creek bottom, and our crews handle both regularly. Call (936) 292-2926 any time for professional septic service.",
  "aboutSection": "Brenham serves as the Washington County seat and the commercial center for a predominantly agricultural area between Houston and Austin along the Highway 290 corridor. With a population around 17,800, the city has a compact municipal sewer district, but the surrounding county is dotted with farms, ranches, and rural homesites that depend entirely on private septic systems. The area's growing popularity as a weekend destination and bedroom community for both metros has brought new construction that further increases the number of systems needing service.\n\nWashington County's terrain is gently rolling, with sandy loam soils on the higher ground and heavier clay in the creek bottoms and drainage areas. The sandy loam, shaped by centuries of post oak savannah ecology, drains well and supports efficient conventional drain fields. The clay pockets, concentrated near the Brazos River and its tributaries like Yegua Creek, drain much more slowly and can lead to waterlogged drain fields during wet seasons.\n\nThe area receives around 40 inches of rainfall annually, which is enough to create periodic stress on systems in the clay zones. Spring rain events can saturate low-lying properties for extended periods, and the Brazos River floodplain adds another layer of risk for properties in the lowest elevations.\n\nCommon issues we encounter in the Brenham area include root intrusion from post oaks and pecans that are abundant across Washington County, aging tanks on older homesteads that predate modern installation standards, and drain field saturation on clay-heavy lots after sustained rainfall. Some properties that were originally built as country weekend retreats have since become permanent residences, and their smaller septic systems struggle to keep up with full-time water usage. Regular maintenance and timely inspections are the best protection against these issues escalating into expensive emergencies.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Brenham?",
      "answer": "Every three to five years for most Brenham homes on sandy loam. Properties on the heavier clay soils near creek drainages in Washington County should plan on pumping every two to three years because the slow-draining soil increases the load on the tank. Weekend-use properties transitioning to full-time occupancy may need immediate evaluation. We can inspect and recommend."
