  "aboutSection": "Boerne sits in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, where scenic limestone bluffs and spring-fed creeks attract homeowners looking for space and natural beauty. But beneath that landscape lies karst geology, a type of terrain defined by soluble limestone bedrock riddled with fractures, caves, and sinkholes, and it creates a uniquely challenging environment for septic systems.\n\nIn Kendall County, many properties have only a thin layer of topsoil over limestone, which limits how deep a conventional drain field can be installed. Some lots require alternative systems like aerobic treatment units or low-pressure dosing systems that can function within the shallow soil profile. Even properties with adequate soil depth face the issue of fractured bedrock allowing partially treated effluent to reach groundwater too quickly, which is a serious concern given that much of the Boerne area sits over the Trinity Aquifer.\n\nThe Edwards Aquifer Authority and TCEQ impose specific rules on septic systems in sensitive recharge areas, and parts of Kendall County fall under those regulations. Homeowners here have a responsibility not just to their own property but to the regional water supply. Regular pumping, timely repairs, and proper system design are essential to meeting those obligations.\n\nCommon Boerne-area septic issues include cedar root intrusion into distribution lines (Ashe juniper is relentless in seeking moisture), cracked tanks caused by shifting limestone substrate, and aerobic system malfunctions where spray heads clog or pumps fail. The area's periodic flash flooding along Cibolo Creek and its tributaries can also saturate drain fields rapidly, especially on properties in lower elevations. If you've noticed your aerobic system alarm going off frequently, sewage odors near the spray field, or wet areas where the ground should be dry, don't wait. These problems only get worse and more expensive with time.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Boerne?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years is typical for Boerne homes with conventional systems. However, the shallow soils and limestone karst conditions in Kendall County mean many systems work harder than average, and some benefit from pumping every two to three years. Aerobic treatment units may need more frequent maintenance checks. We'll assess your specific setup and recommend the right interval."
