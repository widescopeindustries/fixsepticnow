  "aboutSection": "Athens is the Henderson County seat, a community of about 13,000 that serves as the retail and service center for a largely rural county in east-central Texas. Most residential properties outside the small downtown core depend on septic systems, and with Cedar Creek Reservoir and several smaller lakes attracting homeowners and weekend visitors, the number of systems in the area is substantial.\n\nHenderson County's soil profile includes both sandy loam on the higher, well-drained ridges and heavier clay in the bottomlands and drainage areas. The sandy loam performs well for conventional septic drain fields, allowing effluent to percolate at a healthy rate. The clay zones are more problematic, holding water and slowing drainage to the point where drain fields can become saturated during prolonged wet weather. Many Athens-area properties contain both soil types, which means drain field performance can vary across a single lot.\n\nThe lake communities around Cedar Creek and other Henderson County reservoirs add another dimension. Lakefront and near-lake properties often deal with elevated water tables that reduce the effective depth of drain fields. TCEQ requirements near waterways add regulatory considerations as well, since failing systems in these locations can contribute nutrients and pathogens directly to recreational water bodies.\n\nFrequent issues in the Athens area include saturated drain fields on clay-heavy lots, root intrusion from post oaks and hickories that are common in the Cross Timbers vegetation belt, and aging systems on properties that were built as weekend fishing retreats but now function as full-time homes. Seasonal occupancy fluctuations at lake properties can also stress systems that sit unused for weeks and then suddenly handle a full house of guests. Regular pumping and inspection prevent these situations from turning into costly emergencies.",

      "answer": "Every three to four years for most Athens homes on sandy loam. Properties on heavier clay or near the Cedar Creek lakefront where water tables are higher should pump every two to three years. Seasonal-use lake homes should be pumped before heavy-use periods begin. We can evaluate your property and recommend a maintenance cycle."
