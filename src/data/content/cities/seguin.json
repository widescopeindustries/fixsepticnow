  "aboutSection": "Seguin has long served as the seat of Guadalupe County, a community rooted in agriculture and manufacturing that has seen steady residential growth as the San Antonio metro pushes eastward. Many properties here, from working ranches along FM 725 to newer homes off I-10, depend on septic systems because municipal sewer infrastructure hasn't kept pace with development on the edges of town.\n\nThe soil profile across the Seguin area is a tale of two types. Blackland clay, the dark, heavy soil that dominates the prairies east and south of town, expands when wet and contracts when dry. This constant movement puts mechanical stress on tanks, distribution boxes, and drain field piping. It also drains poorly, which means effluent sits in the soil longer and can lead to waterlogged drain fields during extended rainy periods. On the other hand, sandy loam deposits closer to the Guadalupe River corridor drain more readily but can allow contaminants to reach groundwater faster if a system is failing.\n\nGuadalupe County's warm climate encourages bacterial breakdown inside the tank, but it also promotes faster grease and scum accumulation. Homes that rely heavily on garbage disposals or have large families tend to fill tanks ahead of schedule. Most Seguin properties should plan on pumping every three to four years, though properties on tight blackland clay may need to shorten that interval.\n\nProblems we frequently see in the Seguin area include cracked tanks from the shrink-swell cycles of blackland clay, saturated drain fields after heavy spring rains, and distribution line blockages caused by tree roots seeking moisture in the clay. Older properties near downtown Seguin sometimes have undersized or outdated systems that struggle with modern household water volumes. If your toilets gurgle, your yard stays wet near the tank or drain field, or you catch a whiff of sewage on warm afternoons, it's time to call a professional before a minor issue becomes a major repair.",

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Seguin?",
      "answer": "Septic pumping in Seguin runs between $350 and $600 for most residential properties. A standard 1,000-gallon tank typically costs $375 to $475. Properties with deeper tanks, difficult driveway access, or systems overdue for pumping by several years may see higher costs due to extra labor and disposal volume. We provide upfront pricing before any work starts."

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Seguin?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years is standard for most Seguin homes. Properties sitting on the heavy blackland clay soils east of town often benefit from pumping every two to three years because the clay restricts drain field drainage and forces the tank to handle a larger share of the workload. Sandy loam properties near the Guadalupe River may stretch a bit longer. We'll evaluate your system and recommend the right interval."
