  "aboutSection": "Cleburne is the Johnson County seat, positioned where the Blackland Prairie meets the edge of the Cross Timbers region southwest of Fort Worth. Growth in the southern DFW metro has brought steady development to the Cleburne area, and many of those newer homes sit outside municipal sewer boundaries on private septic systems. Older properties on the outskirts of town have been running on septic for decades.\n\nThe defining feature of Cleburne's landscape, from a septic perspective, is blackland clay. This dark, heavy soil is notorious across north Texas for its shrink-swell behavior. During wet periods, the clay absorbs water and expands, which can lift or shift tanks and compress drain field piping. During drought, it contracts and cracks, leaving gaps around tanks where surface water can infiltrate and creating uneven stress on rigid pipe connections. This constant movement is the single biggest threat to septic system longevity in Johnson County.\n\nDrain fields in blackland clay also face a drainage disadvantage. Clay particles are so fine that water moves through them slowly, which means effluent doesn't percolate away from distribution lines efficiently. After extended rain, it's common for Cleburne-area drain fields to become temporarily saturated, pushing partially treated wastewater toward the surface. This is why pumping frequency matters more here than in areas with sandier soils.\n\nFrequent issues in the Cleburne area include cracked concrete tanks from clay movement, collapsed or misaligned distribution lines, and drain field failure in low-lying areas that collect runoff. Tree root intrusion is another concern, particularly from the large pecan and bois d'arc trees common in older Cleburne neighborhoods. If you notice soft or wet spots over your drain field, sewage smells in the yard, or toilets that flush slowly despite clear interior plumbing, your system is signaling a problem that will only worsen without professional intervention.",

We quote every job upfront."

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Cleburne?",
      "answer": "Every two to three years is wise for most Cleburne homes. Johnson County's heavy blackland clay restricts drain field drainage significantly, which means your tank works harder than it would in sandier ground. Larger households or properties with older, smaller tanks may need even more frequent service. We can inspect your system and recommend the right pumping interval."
