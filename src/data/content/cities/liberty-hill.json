  "aboutSection": "Liberty Hill occupies a stretch of Williamson County where the Blackland Prairie begins to give way to the rugged limestone of the Edwards Plateau. This transitional geology makes it one of the more challenging areas in Central Texas for septic system installation and maintenance. Municipal sewer service is extremely limited, and the explosive residential growth over the past decade means thousands of homes now depend on private septic systems that must perform in difficult ground conditions.\n\nThe soil profile around Liberty Hill is a mix of limestone bedrock and rocky clay, often with very shallow soil cover. In many locations, you hit solid rock within a few feet of the surface. This limited soil depth restricts the types of systems that can be installed and reduces the natural treatment capacity of the ground. Conventional gravity drain fields, which rely on adequate soil depth for effluent filtration, often aren't feasible here. Instead, most Liberty Hill properties use engineered alternatives like aerobic treatment units with surface spray application or subsurface drip irrigation.\n\nThese alternative systems work well when properly maintained, but they have more moving parts than a simple gravity system. Aerobic units depend on air pumps, chlorine disinfection, and spray heads or drip emitters that can clog, break, or run dry. Quarterly maintenance inspections are typically required by the manufacturer and by Williamson County permitting. Skipping them is a recipe for system failure and potential permit violations.\n\nLiberty Hill's growth has also compressed the timeline for many of these issues. Systems installed just five or ten years ago are already showing wear because they were pushed to minimum lot sizes on marginal soil, and maintenance was deferred by busy homeowners who didn't fully understand their system's needs. We see a steady volume of calls from Liberty Hill neighborhoods dealing with spray field malfunctions, alarm activations, and odor complaints that trace back to deferred service.\n\nThe rocky terrain also means repair and replacement work is physically demanding. Trenching through limestone requires specialized equipment, and access on some Liberty Hill properties can be tight. These aren't obstacles for our crews; they're the daily reality of Hill Country septic work.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Liberty Hill?",
      "answer": "Liberty Hill's shallow rocky soil provides minimal natural filtration, so keeping your tank properly maintained is critical. We recommend pumping every two to three years for most homes. Aerobic systems also need quarterly maintenance inspections to keep air pumps, chlorine dispensers, and spray heads functioning.
