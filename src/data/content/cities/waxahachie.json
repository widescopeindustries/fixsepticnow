  "aboutSection": "Waxahachie is the county seat of Ellis County and sits squarely in the heart of the Texas Blackland Prairie, a geographic region defined by its dark, heavy clay soil. While the town's Victorian architecture and film-friendly downtown get the attention, it's the ground beneath the surface that matters most to the thousands of homeowners operating septic systems in the surrounding area.\n\nBlackland clay is among the most difficult soil types for septic drain fields in all of Texas. When it rains, the clay absorbs water and swells, effectively sealing the surface and preventing effluent from percolating downward through the drain field. When drought returns, the clay shrinks and cracks, sometimes dramatically, which can shift tanks, snap rigid PVC distribution lines, and create preferential flow paths where wastewater channels through gaps instead of filtering evenly through the soil.\n\nThis constant expansion and contraction cycle means septic systems in the Waxahachie area take a beating that systems in sandier soils simply don't experience. Tanks crack, baffles break loose, and drain field lines lose their grade. Homeowners who stay ahead of maintenance avoid the worst of it, but those who neglect their systems often face expensive repairs.\n\nEllis County has seen significant growth as DFW residents seek more affordable land south of the metro, and many of those newer subdivisions off Highway 287 and I-35E rely entirely on septic. New systems are designed for the clay conditions, but they still need regular pumping and monitoring. Older systems on properties closer to downtown Waxahachie were often built to less rigorous standards and are now showing their age. Root intrusion from the large oaks and pecans that shade Waxahachie's older neighborhoods is another persistent issue. If you're dealing with slow drains, soggy patches in the yard, or sewage odors, your system needs attention now, not next month.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Waxahachie?",
      "answer": "Every two to four years, depending on your soil and household. Waxahachie's heavy blackland clay drains slowly, which means your drain field processes effluent less efficiently than it would in sandier soil. That puts more burden on the tank itself. Most homes here benefit from pumping every two to three years. We can inspect your system and recommend a maintenance cycle."
