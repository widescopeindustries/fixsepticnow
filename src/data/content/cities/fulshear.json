  "aboutSection": "Fulshear's population has surged as master-planned communities have spread across former ranchland west of Katy. While many of these developments include municipal utility district infrastructure, a considerable number of Fulshear-area properties rely on private septic systems, particularly those on larger lots, in older parts of town, or in areas that developed ahead of sewer infrastructure buildout.\n\nThe clay loam soil that dominates the Fulshear area falls between pure sand and heavy clay on the drainage spectrum, but it leans closer to clay in behavior. Drainage is slow enough to stress drain fields during wet weather, and the soil's tendency to expand and contract seasonally can shift system components over time. These aren't catastrophic issues when systems are properly designed and maintained, but they do require attention that homeowners in sandier regions might not need to worry about.\n\nFulshear's rapid growth has also created a community where a significant percentage of septic systems are relatively new. New systems bring their own set of considerations. Aerobic treatment units, which are common in newer Fulshear developments, require quarterly maintenance visits that many first-time septic owners aren't aware of. Missing these visits can void manufacturer warranties and allow the system to deteriorate rapidly. Spray heads can clog, air pumps can fail, and chlorine dispensers run empty if nobody checks them.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, original Fulshear-area properties along FM 359 and near the Brazos River corridor may have systems dating back decades. These older installations were often designed for smaller households and built with materials that have limited lifespans. If you've purchased one of these properties, an inspection before you close or shortly after is a smart move.\n\nWhether your system is brand new or approaching retirement age, consistent professional service is the key to avoiding costly failures and protecting your property value in this competitive real estate market.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Fulshear?",
      "answer": "Fulshear's clay loam soil drains slowly enough that we recommend pumping every two to four years for conventional systems. Aerobic treatment units need quarterly maintenance checks in addition to periodic pumping. Newer homes with smaller lots and higher-density living should pump more frequently. We can evaluate your system and set a customized schedule."
