  "aboutSection": "San Marcos has grown rapidly as both a university town and a residential hub between Austin and San Antonio. That growth has pushed development into areas well beyond city sewer service, particularly in the hills west of town and the ranch land stretching toward Wimberley and Kyle. Thousands of Hays County properties depend on septic systems, and the wide range of soil and rock conditions here means no two installations are quite the same.\n\nThe western side of San Marcos sits on Edwards limestone, the same fractured karst terrain that characterizes the Hill Country. Properties here often have thin topsoil over bedrock, which limits conventional drain field options and sometimes requires engineered systems like aerobic treatment units. This area also falls within the Edwards Aquifer recharge and contributing zones, where TCEQ regulations govern how septic systems must be designed and maintained to protect groundwater.\n\nEast of I-35, the landscape flattens into Blackland Prairie with its characteristic heavy, dark clay soil. This clay expands dramatically when wet and shrinks when dry, creating a constant cycle of ground movement that can crack tanks, shift distribution lines, and compromise drain field integrity over time. Clay also drains slowly, which means drain fields on the east side of San Marcos work harder than those on well-drained limestone.\n\nCommon issues we address in the San Marcos area include root intrusion from live oaks and mountain cedar on the west side, clay-related tank stress on the east side, and seasonal flooding near the San Marcos and Blanco rivers that can overwhelm systems in low-lying areas. Student rental properties near Texas State sometimes see higher-than-normal usage that accelerates tank filling. Whatever the situation, regular maintenance is the best defense against expensive failures.",

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in San Marcos?",
      "answer": "Most San Marcos septic pump-outs fall between $350 and $625. A standard 1,000-gallon residential tank typically runs $375 to $500. Properties on steep Hill Country lots west of I-35 may cost a bit more due to access challenges. Overdue systems with heavy sludge buildup also require extra labor. We always quote the job before we begin."

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in San Marcos?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years is typical for most San Marcos homes. Properties on the heavy blackland clay east of I-35 may need pumping every two to three years because the slow-draining soil puts extra load on the system. Homes west of town on limestone with shallow soil profiles also benefit from shorter intervals. We can inspect your system and recommend a schedule based on your specific conditions."
