  "aboutSection": "Elgin sits at a crossroads in Bastrop County where Austin's suburban expansion meets the agricultural landscape of central Texas, and that mix means a lot of properties operating on private septic systems. From established homesteads along FM 1704 to newer subdivisions east of Highway 95, thousands of Elgin-area residents depend on their septic tanks and drain fields working correctly every day.\n\nSoil conditions across the Elgin area vary more than most homeowners realize. The sandy loam that characterizes much of western Bastrop County allows decent drainage and is generally favorable for conventional drain fields. But as you move through different parts of the Elgin area, pockets of stiff clay appear, particularly in low-lying areas near creek beds and along the Colorado River basin to the south. Clay soil holds water instead of letting it percolate, which puts extra stress on drain field lines and can lead to saturation, standing water, and eventual system failure if the tank isn't maintained on schedule.\n\nThe warm Texas climate keeps bacterial activity high inside the tank, which helps break down solids but also accelerates scum and grease buildup. Homes with garbage disposals or larger families tend to fill tanks faster than the three-to-four-year average most Elgin properties follow. Properties on tighter clay soils should plan for more frequent service.\n\nCommon problems we encounter in Bastrop County include root intrusion from live oaks and pecan trees that seek out moisture in distribution pipes, cracked baffles in older concrete tanks, and compacted drain fields from vehicles or heavy equipment parked over the leach area. Elgin's periodic heavy rains can also temporarily raise the water table, which reduces your drain field's ability to absorb effluent. If drains are running slow, you smell sulfur in the yard, or you see wet spots where the ground should be dry, your system is telling you it needs professional attention.",

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Elgin?",
      "answer": "Septic pumping in Elgin typically runs between $350 and $600 depending on tank size, depth, and how long it's been since the last service.

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Elgin?",
      "answer": "Most Elgin homes do well on a three-to-four-year pumping cycle. However, if your property sits on the clay-heavy soil found in parts of Bastrop County, your drain field works harder and your tank may need pumping every two to three years. Household size and water usage also factor in. We can inspect your system and set up a maintenance schedule tailored to your specific soil and usage."
