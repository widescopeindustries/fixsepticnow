  "aboutSection": "Magnolia is one of those Texas towns where the zip code covers far more territory than the town itself. The small downtown along FM 1774 anchors a community that sprawls across northwestern Montgomery County, and virtually all of it sits beyond municipal sewer service. Septic systems aren't an alternative here; they're the only option, and keeping them in good working order is essential to daily life on these properties.\n\nThe sandy loam that blankets the Magnolia area is among the best soil types for conventional septic systems. Good percolation rates allow effluent to filter naturally through the ground, and the soil's moderate structure resists the extreme swelling and shrinking that plagues clay-heavy areas to the south. That said, Magnolia's sandy soil also means that a failing system can contaminate groundwater more quickly than it would in tighter soils, making regular maintenance not just practical but important for protecting your well water.\n\nMany Magnolia properties are larger rural tracts with older systems that were installed decades ago when the area was primarily ranching and farming country. These legacy systems often feature oversized concrete tanks and gravity-fed drain fields that have performed reliably for years. But time catches up with every system. Concrete deteriorates, baffles break, and tree roots find their way into distribution lines. A system that was adequate for a ranch house may also be undersized if the property has been expanded or a second dwelling added.\n\nThe newer subdivisions and acreage developments pushing into the Magnolia area bring modern aerobic systems and engineered drain fields. These perform well in local soil conditions but require consistent maintenance, including inspections, chlorine management, and air pump monitoring. We service both old-school gravity systems and modern aerobic units, so whatever sits in your yard, we can keep it running.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Magnolia?",
      "answer": "Magnolia's sandy loam soil drains efficiently, so most conventional systems do well on a three- to five-year pumping schedule. Properties with well water should consider pumping more frequently as a precaution against groundwater contamination. Aerobic units need quarterly maintenance visits regardless of soil type. We'll assess your specific setup and recommend the right timing."
