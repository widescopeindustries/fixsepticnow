  "aboutSection": "Corsicana is the largest city in Navarro County and serves as the economic center for a wide stretch of rural north-central Texas between Dallas and the Piney Woods. Outside the older city center, which has municipal sewer, the majority of residential properties in the county operate on individual septic systems. That includes everything from longtime family farms to newer homes built along the I-45 growth corridor.\n\nNavarro County sits firmly within the Blackland Prairie, and the soil reflects it. Heavy, dark clay dominates the landscape and presents the same challenges here that it does across the entire region: poor drainage, aggressive shrink-swell behavior through seasonal wet-dry cycles, and mechanical stress on buried infrastructure. Drain fields in this clay work harder than those in looser soils because water passes through the fine clay particles slowly, extending the time that effluent sits in the ground before being absorbed.\n\nThe area's agricultural heritage means many older properties have septic systems that were installed when the land was farmed or ranched with minimal household water use. As those properties get converted to full-time residential use or as families grow, the original system capacity can become inadequate. Navarro County also has pockets where Richland Creek and the Corsicana reservoir system create seasonally higher water tables, further stressing drain fields on lower ground.\n\nIssues we commonly handle in Corsicana include tank damage from clay expansion and contraction, oversaturated drain fields after spring rains, root intrusion from the mesquite and hackberry trees that dot Navarro County properties, and pump malfunctions in lift station systems. If you've noticed wet areas over your drain field during dry weather, persistent sewage odors, or slow drains throughout the house, those are clear indicators your system needs professional evaluation.",

      "answer": "Corsicana septic pumping costs between $350 and $600 for most homes. Standard 1,000-gallon tanks typically run $350 to $450. Rural properties with longer access drives or systems that are many years overdue for pumping may cost more due to additional labor and disposal. We always give you a price before we start the job."

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Corsicana?",
      "answer": "Every two to four years for most Corsicana properties. The heavy blackland clay in Navarro County slows drain field absorption, which means sludge and scum accumulate in the tank faster than in areas with better-draining soil. Homes with larger families or properties on especially tight clay should lean toward the two-year mark. We can inspect your setup and recommend a schedule that keeps your system healthy."
