  "aboutSection": "Granbury is the heart of Hood County, a lakeside community that draws both permanent residents and weekend visitors to the shores of Lake Granbury on the Brazos River. Many properties here, from established homes on the lake to newer developments on the rolling hills south and west of the historic downtown square, operate on septic systems because municipal sewer lines don't extend to every corner of the county.\n\nThe soil profile across the Granbury area includes sandy loam on higher ground and limestone substrate that surfaces in patches throughout Hood County, particularly on the western side toward the Paluxy River drainage. Sandy loam provides good natural drainage for conventional drain fields, while limestone areas present challenges similar to Hill Country terrain: shallow bedrock, limited soil depth, and the need for careful system design to ensure adequate treatment before effluent reaches groundwater.\n\nLakefront properties face their own set of challenges. Higher water tables near the shoreline reduce the effective depth of drain fields, and seasonal lake level changes can further compress that margin. TCEQ regulations also apply more stringently near waterways, as failing septic systems can contribute nutrients and pathogens directly to Lake Granbury.\n\nCommon issues we address in Hood County include saturated drain fields on lake-adjacent lots, root intrusion from the live oaks and mesquite that dominate the landscape, and aging systems on older lakeside cabins that were originally built for weekend use but now serve as full-time residences. The increased water demand from year-round occupancy often exceeds what these older, smaller systems were designed to handle. Pump failures in lift station systems on sloped lakefront lots are another frequent call. Regular maintenance keeps these problems manageable and protects both your property and the lake.",

Lakefront properties with access challenges or steep terrain may cost a bit more. Systems overdue for service by several years will need additional labor and disposal. We provide a clear quote before beginning any work."

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Granbury?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years is a good baseline for most Granbury homes. Lakefront properties or those on shallow limestone should lean toward the shorter end of that range because reduced drain field capacity means the tank bears a heavier load. Former weekend cabins now used full-time may need pumping every two to three years until the system is evaluated for capacity. We'll help you set the right schedule."
