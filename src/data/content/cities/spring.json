  "aboutSection": "Spring is an unincorporated community in northern Harris County that has exploded in population over the past two decades. Much of that growth has occurred in areas beyond the reach of municipal sewer infrastructure, which means a significant share of Spring-area homes operate on private septic systems. From established neighborhoods along Spring-Cypress Road to newer developments near the Hardy Toll Road, septic is simply part of life here.\n\nThe predominant soil type in the Spring area is sandy clay loam, a mixed profile that offers moderate drainage. It's not as porous as the sandy loam found further north in Montgomery County, but it performs considerably better than the heavy Beaumont clay found to the west and south. This middle ground means that conventional drain fields generally work well in Spring, though the clay component can slow things down during extended wet periods.\n\nSpring's proximity to Cypress Creek and Spring Creek means that water tables can fluctuate significantly, especially after heavy rainfall events that are common in this part of Texas. When groundwater rises, it can reduce the effective depth of your drain field and push partially treated effluent toward the surface. Homeowners near creek corridors should be particularly attentive to system performance during and after storms.\n\nThe most common septic issues we encounter in the Spring area include clogged effluent filters, root intrusion from the mature hardwoods and pines that shade many properties, and aging systems in neighborhoods built during the 1980s and 1990s boom. Many of these older systems used concrete distribution boxes and clay pipe that deteriorate over time. A professional inspection can identify failing components before they cause a full backup. We also see a fair number of systems stressed by additions or converted garages that increased household occupancy beyond what the original system was designed to handle.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Spring?",
      "answer": "Spring's sandy clay loam soil provides decent drainage, so most homes can follow a three- to four-year pumping schedule. However, properties closer to creek floodplains or in areas with heavier clay content may benefit from pumping every two to three years. Household size and water usage habits also play a role. We can assess your system and recommend the right interval."
