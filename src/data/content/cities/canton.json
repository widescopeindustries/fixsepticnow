  "aboutSection": "Canton is a small Van Zandt County community with an outsized reputation thanks to First Monday Trade Days, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors monthly. But beyond the flea market grounds, Canton and the surrounding countryside are home to families on acreage properties that rely almost exclusively on septic systems for wastewater management.\n\nVan Zandt County sits in a transitional zone between the Blackland Prairie to the west and the Piney Woods to the east, and the soil reflects that geographic position. Sandy loam dominates many of the higher, well-drained areas, providing good conditions for conventional drain fields. But significant pockets of heavier clay appear throughout the county, particularly in low-lying areas near the Sabine River and its tributaries. Properties that straddle both soil types, which is common around Canton, may have drain fields that perform well on one end and struggle on the other.\n\nThe area's rolling terrain also means many properties require lift stations or pressure distribution systems to move effluent uphill to drain fields positioned on better-draining ground. These mechanical components add maintenance requirements that gravity-fed systems don't have, and pump failures are one of the more common service calls we handle here.\n\nOther frequent issues in the Canton area include aging systems on older rural homesteads that were never designed for modern water usage, root intrusion from the mix of hardwoods and pines that grow throughout Van Zandt County, and seasonal flooding near creek drainages that temporarily overwhelms drain fields. Canton's population may be small, but the number of septic systems per capita is high, and keeping them maintained protects both individual properties and the area's water quality.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Canton?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years works for most Canton homes on sandy loam. Properties sitting on the heavier clay pockets found in parts of Van Zandt County should pump every two to three years because the clay slows drain field absorption. Household size and water habits matter too. We can evaluate your system and set a maintenance schedule that fits your property."
