  "aboutSection": "Leander's growth trajectory has been extraordinary. What was a town of a few thousand people twenty years ago is now a city of over 75,000, with new neighborhoods continuing to push north and west into areas where municipal sewer has yet to arrive. A substantial number of Leander-area homes, particularly in the newer western developments and on larger lots, operate on private septic systems.\n\nThe geology beneath Leander is transitional. The eastern portion of the city sits on clay soil similar to the Blackland Prairie formations found across much of Williamson County. Moving west, the terrain shifts into the limestone and thin-soil landscape of the Edwards Plateau. This means that two Leander homes a few miles apart may face completely different septic challenges, and the solutions that work for one property may be entirely wrong for the other.\n\nProperties on the clay side deal with the familiar problems of slow drainage, seasonal soil movement, and drain fields that struggle during wet weather. These systems benefit from regular pumping and inspections to catch issues before the clay's behavior turns a minor problem into a costly repair.\n\nProperties on the limestone side face thin soil cover, rocky conditions that complicate installation and repair, and the environmental sensitivity of building over karst terrain. Many of these homes use aerobic treatment units with spray or drip distribution, which require quarterly professional maintenance to function properly. The fractured limestone provides minimal natural filtration, so system integrity directly affects groundwater quality.\n\nLeander's explosive growth has also created situations where development outpaced infrastructure planning. Some neighborhoods built in the late 2000s and 2010s have systems that were designed for anticipated sewer connections that never materialized. These systems may have been built as temporary solutions and are now aging into permanent infrastructure without the durability to match. If your system is in this category, a professional assessment can help you plan ahead.",
