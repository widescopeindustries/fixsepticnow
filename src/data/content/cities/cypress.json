  "aboutSection": "Cypress is an expansive unincorporated area in northwest Harris County that straddles the line between suburban development and lingering rural character. While many of the master-planned communities along US 290 and the Grand Parkway connect to municipal utility districts, a substantial number of Cypress properties, particularly older ones and those on larger lots, depend entirely on private septic systems.\n\nThe heavy clay soil found throughout the Cypress area is the single biggest factor affecting septic system performance here. Clay has extremely low percolation rates, which means wastewater moves through the drain field slowly. During Houston's frequent heavy rain events, the soil becomes waterlogged and can stop accepting effluent altogether. This puts enormous stress on the system and is the leading cause of drain field failures in the Cypress area.\n\nSeasonal soil movement compounds the problem. Cypress clay expands when wet and contracts when dry, creating a cycle that can shift concrete tanks, crack PVC distribution lines, and open gaps around pipe connections. Homeowners often notice these issues as unexplained wet spots in the yard during rainy periods or cracks appearing in the ground near the tank during summer droughts.\n\nBecause of these soil conditions, many newer Cypress homes were built with engineered systems designed to compensate for poor natural drainage. These include aerobic treatment units, drip irrigation drain fields, and mound systems that elevate the absorption area above the native clay. All of these alternatives require more active maintenance than a standard gravity system. Aerobic units need quarterly inspections, drip systems need filter cleaning, and mound systems need periodic evaluation to ensure the imported fill soil hasn't compacted.\n\nRegardless of system type, Cypress homeowners benefit from a more aggressive maintenance schedule than properties in sandier areas. Regular pumping, annual inspections, and prompt attention to warning signs will keep your system functional and protect your investment.",

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Cypress?",
      "answer": "Cypress septic pumping usually falls between $375 and $625. Heavy clay soil can make locating and uncovering tank lids more labor-intensive, which sometimes adds to the cost. A typical 1,000-gallon residential tank costs around $400 to $500 to pump. We provide honest pricing before work begins so you're never caught off guard."

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Cypress?",
      "answer": "Given Cypress's heavy clay soil, we recommend pumping every two to three years for most households. The slow drainage puts extra burden on your system, and keeping solids low in the tank is the best way to protect your drain field. Homes with aerobic units should also maintain their quarterly inspection schedule. We can assess your system and set up a maintenance plan."
