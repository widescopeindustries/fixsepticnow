  "heroDescription": "Waller is farm and ranch country at its core, and out here septic systems are as essential as a good fence line. Fix Septic Now provides 24/7 septic pumping, repair, and installation across Waller and the surrounding Waller County landscape. The mixed sandy loam and clay soils in this area require a service team that understands how different ground conditions affect system performance from property to property.

  "aboutSection": "Waller County sits between the western edge of the Houston metro and the beginning of the Brazos River bottomlands, and the town of Waller serves as its practical center. There's no large-scale municipal sewer system serving the surrounding area, which means homes, ranches, and small businesses across the county rely on private septic systems. It's been that way for generations, and with the area's gradual growth, the number of systems in service continues to increase.\n\nThe soil profile around Waller is transitional. You'll find sandy loam on higher ground and in areas closer to the pine belt to the north, while heavier clay deposits show up in the bottomland areas and lower-lying fields closer to the Brazos. This mix means that two properties a mile apart might have very different drainage characteristics, and a system design that works perfectly on one could struggle on the other. Soil testing and site-specific design are critical in Waller County.\n\nThe agricultural character of the area introduces some septic considerations that don't come up as often in suburban settings. Properties with livestock need to manage runoff carefully to avoid overloading the soil around drain fields. Equipment traffic over drain field areas is a common cause of soil compaction and line damage on working farms. And older ranch properties may have systems that predate modern permitting requirements, with minimal documentation about tank location, size, or drain field layout.\n\nWaller's steady growth as a bedroom community for Houston commuters has also brought a wave of new construction on former farmland. Many of these homes sit on engineered aerobic systems that require regular maintenance to function properly. The transition from rural to residential use means the septic infrastructure in Waller County spans a wide range of ages, types, and conditions, and servicing all of them effectively takes real local knowledge.",
  "whyChooseSection": "Fix Septic Now has worked across Waller County long enough to know where the sandy loam gives way to clay, which roads turn to mud in the rain, and which old ranch systems were built to last versus those that are hanging on by a thread. That granular knowledge matters when you're diagnosing a problem or designing a new installation. We're available 24/7, which matters in a rural area where options can be limited. Our pricing is fair and transparent, and our crews know how to operate around livestock, fencing, and the realities of working agricultural properties. Call (936) 292-2926.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Waller?",
      "answer": "It depends on your soil. Properties on Waller County's sandy loam soils can often go three to five years between pumpings. Homes sitting on heavier clay, particularly in lower-lying areas, should pump every two to three years to prevent drain field stress. Household size and whether you have a conventional or aerobic system also factor into the schedule."
