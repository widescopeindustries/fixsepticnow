  "aboutSection": "Georgetown is one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in Williamson County, but substantial portions of the surrounding area remain beyond the reach of municipal sewer service. Properties on the city's outskirts, along ranch roads to the west, and in the more rural eastern stretches toward Taylor and Hutto frequently depend on private septic systems. Even within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, septic is often the only option for new construction on larger lots.\n\nThe geology around Georgetown is split. East of town, the terrain flattens into the Blackland Prairie with deep, expansive clay soil that behaves much like the challenging clays found in the Houston metro. These soils swell dramatically when wet and crack when dry, creating seasonal movement that stresses tanks, pipes, and drain field structures. Conventional systems in blackland clay need careful installation with adequate setbacks from foundations and drainage considerations that account for the soil's tendency to hold water.\n\nWest of Georgetown, the landscape transitions into the limestone terrain of the Edwards Plateau. Here, soil cover thins out, bedrock surfaces, and the engineering challenges shift from managing heavy clay to working with minimal soil depth. Many western Georgetown properties require aerobic treatment units or engineered drain fields designed specifically for rocky, shallow soil conditions.\n\nThis geological split means Georgetown septic work requires a versatile skill set. A company that only knows clay won't perform well on the west side, and a Hill Country specialist may miss the nuances of blackland expansion on the east side. The Georgetown area demands a service provider comfortable with both environments.\n\nLake Georgetown and the North Fork of the San Gabriel River also influence local septic considerations. Properties in the watershed face stricter permitting requirements and carry a greater responsibility for preventing effluent from reaching surface water. Proper system maintenance isn't just about avoiding backups in Georgetown; it's about protecting the water resources the community depends on.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Georgetown?",
      "answer": "It depends on which side of Georgetown's geological divide you sit on. Properties in the blackland clay east of town should pump every two to three years due to slow soil drainage. Homes on the limestone west side with aerobic systems also benefit from pumping every two to three years, plus quarterly maintenance inspections. We'll assess your property and recommend the right schedule."
