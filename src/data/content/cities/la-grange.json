  "aboutSection": "La Grange sits along the Colorado River in Fayette County, roughly midway between Houston and Austin on Highway 71. With a population around 4,900, the city maintains a small sewer district, but the vast majority of Fayette County's residential properties operate on individual septic systems. The area's agricultural heritage, Czech and German cultural roots, and scenic rolling landscape have also attracted newcomers looking for weekend retreats and permanent homesites, adding to the number of systems that need regular professional care.\n\nFayette County's soil profile is a mix of sandy loam on the upland ridges and heavier clay in the bottomlands near the Colorado River and its tributaries. The sandy loam areas, which make up much of the higher terrain, are well-suited to conventional drain fields. Water moves through the soil at a steady rate, providing adequate filtration and treatment of effluent. The clay zones, particularly in the floodplain south and east of La Grange, drain more slowly and are more prone to saturation during extended wet periods.\n\nThe Colorado River corridor creates additional considerations for properties near the water. Periodic flooding can temporarily submerge low-lying septic systems, and the water table in the floodplain tends to run higher than on the upland ridges. Homeowners in these areas should plan for more frequent inspections and potentially shorter pumping intervals.\n\nTypical issues in the La Grange area include aging concrete tanks that have developed cracks over decades, root intrusion from the large pecan trees that are iconic in Fayette County, and undersized systems on properties that were originally designed for seasonal or light use. Many older ranch homesteads have septic systems that were installed before current TCEQ standards and may need updating to handle modern household water volumes. Catching these issues early through regular maintenance always costs less than dealing with a full system failure.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in La Grange?",
      "answer": "Every three to five years for homes on the sandy loam ridges. Properties in the clay bottomlands near the Colorado River should pump every two to three years because slower drainage increases the load on the tank. Seasonal-use properties should be pumped before periods of heavy use. We can evaluate your specific conditions and recommend the right schedule."
