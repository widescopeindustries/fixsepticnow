  "aboutSection": "Dripping Springs has transformed from a sleepy Hill Country crossroads into one of the most desirable communities in the Austin metro. That growth has pushed residential development across a landscape where municipal sewer infrastructure is sparse and the geology makes extending it expensive. The result is that the vast majority of Dripping Springs-area homes, whether they're on five-acre lots or in master-planned communities, rely on private septic systems.\n\nThe geology here is fundamentally different from the Houston-area clay and sandy loam most Texas septic companies are used to working in. Dripping Springs sits on the Edwards Plateau, where limestone bedrock lies close to the surface and soil cover is often measured in inches rather than feet. This thin layer of clay over rock creates real engineering challenges for drain fields. There simply isn't enough natural soil in many locations to provide adequate treatment depth for a conventional system.\n\nAs a result, many Dripping Springs properties use alternative treatment systems, including aerobic units with spray distribution, low-pressure dosing systems, and drip irrigation fields. These systems are engineered to work within the site's limitations, but they require more active maintenance than gravity systems in deeper soils. Spray heads need clearing, pumps need monitoring, and the treatment units themselves need regular inspection and servicing.\n\nThe karst geology that underlies Dripping Springs also means that groundwater contamination is a serious concern. Limestone is porous and riddled with fractures and voids that can transmit poorly treated effluent directly to the aquifer with minimal natural filtration. This makes proper system function not just a convenience issue but an environmental responsibility, especially for properties over the sensitive Edwards Aquifer recharge zone.\n\nSeasonal conditions in the Hill Country add further stress. Extended dry spells harden the thin clay soil and can cause spray field areas to crust over, reducing absorption. Conversely, heavy rain events on shallow soil can saturate the limited treatment zone quickly. Both extremes demand a system that's properly maintained and monitored.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Dripping Springs?",
      "answer": "The thin soil and limestone geology in Dripping Springs mean systems need to be kept in top condition. We recommend pumping every two to three years for most households. Properties on the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone or those using aerobic systems should also maintain quarterly inspections. The limited natural filtration in Hill Country soil makes a proactive maintenance schedule especially important."
