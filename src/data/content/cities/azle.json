  "heroDescription": "Tucked between Eagle Mountain Lake and the rolling hills northwest of Fort Worth, Azle is a community where acreage living and septic systems go hand in hand. Fix Septic Now provides 24/7 septic pumping, repair, and installation across Azle and the surrounding Tarrant and Parker County areas. The sandy loam soils here are generally friendly to drain fields, but lakeside properties and low-lying lots bring their own drainage complications. Our crews know this terrain well. Call (936) 292-2926 any hour for service you can count on.",
  "aboutSection": "Azle sits at the northwestern edge of the DFW metroplex where Tarrant and Parker counties meet, a transitional zone between dense suburbia and the open ranch land of the Cross Timbers region. With a population just over 13,000 and much of the surrounding area outside city sewer service, septic systems are the norm rather than the exception for Azle-area homeowners.\n\nThe predominant soil type around Azle is sandy loam, which is one of the better natural soils for septic drain field performance. Sand particles allow water to percolate at a steady rate, giving the soil time to filter and treat effluent before it reaches groundwater. However, Azle's proximity to Eagle Mountain Lake introduces complications for waterfront and near-lake properties. Higher water tables near the shoreline reduce the available soil column for treatment, and seasonal lake level fluctuations can temporarily saturate drain fields on lower lots.\n\nProperties along the creek drainages feeding into the West Fork of the Trinity River face similar seasonal challenges. After heavy rains, these low areas hold water longer than the upland sandy loam, and systems in those locations need to be designed and maintained with that in mind.\n\nCommon problems we see in the Azle area include pump failures in lift station systems used on properties with terrain changes, root intrusion from post oak and elm trees, and deteriorating older tanks on properties that were built in the 1970s and 1980s when Azle first started growing as a bedroom community for Fort Worth. Some of those older systems used steel tanks that have corroded over the decades, and many are due for replacement. Lake-area properties also deal with higher usage during summer months when guests increase water consumption beyond the system's normal load. Staying on a regular pumping and inspection schedule is the most reliable way to prevent a small issue from becoming a weekend emergency.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Azle?",
      "answer": "Most Azle homes on sandy loam can go three to five years between pumpings. Properties closer to Eagle Mountain Lake or in lower-lying areas where seasonal water tables rise may need service every two to three years. Larger households will fill tanks faster regardless of soil type. We can evaluate your system and recommend the ideal pumping frequency for your specific property."
