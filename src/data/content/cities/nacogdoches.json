  "aboutSection": "Nacogdoches is a city with deep roots, both historically and literally. As the seat of Nacogdoches County and home to Stephen F. Austin State University, it combines small-city amenities with a surrounding landscape of pine forest, rolling hills, and creek-fed bottomlands. Outside the older municipal sewer zones, septic systems are the standard across the county, serving everything from student housing to multi-generational family properties.\n\nThe soils in the Nacogdoches area are a mix of sandy loam on the uplands and red clay in the lower areas and hillsides. This two-soil dynamic creates distinctly different septic conditions depending on where your property sits. The sandy loam areas drain well and are favorable for conventional drain fields, while the red clay pockets hold water, drain slowly, and can become saturated during the region's frequent rain events. Properties that span both soil types, which is common on larger rural tracts, may have drain fields that perform unevenly.\n\nThe red clay in particular deserves attention because it behaves differently from the blackland clay found in central Texas. East Texas red clay is typically less expansive but still drains poorly, creating conditions where effluent pools around distribution lines instead of percolating into the deeper soil. Over time, this leads to biomat buildup, reduced absorption, and eventual drain field failure.\n\nCommon issues we see in Nacogdoches County include root intrusion from loblolly pines and water oaks, pump failures on sloped properties, and aging systems that were installed before modern design standards. Properties near La Nana Creek and other waterways face periodic flooding that can overwhelm low-lying drain fields. The university-area rental market also generates systems that run at high capacity with frequent tenant turnover, making regular maintenance even more critical.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Nacogdoches?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years for homes on sandy loam. Properties on the red clay soils found in parts of Nacogdoches County should pump every two to three years because the clay limits drain field efficiency. Rental properties near the university with higher occupancy often benefit from more frequent pumping as well. We can evaluate your situation and recommend the right schedule."
