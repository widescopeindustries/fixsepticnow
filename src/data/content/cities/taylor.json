  "aboutSection": "Taylor sits firmly in the Blackland Prairie of eastern Williamson County, a landscape of deep clay soils and flat terrain that has defined the area's character for generations. While the city has attracted significant attention recently due to large-scale industrial investments, much of the surrounding area remains rural, and municipal sewer service extends only so far. Properties outside city limits and many within it depend on private septic systems to manage their wastewater.\n\nThe blackland clay around Taylor is among the most expansive in the region. It's a soil that has real personality: sticky and impenetrable when wet, cracked and shifting when dry. For septic systems, this translates to drain fields that can go from functioning to flooded after a few days of rain, and tanks that slowly migrate position as the soil around them expands and contracts with the seasons. Over years and decades, this movement can crack concrete, separate pipe joints, and create pathways for groundwater to enter the system.\n\nTaylor's farming legacy means that some properties were equipped with septic systems long before modern permitting and design standards existed. These older installations may lack proper baffles, have undersized drain fields, or use materials that have deteriorated well past their useful life. Properties that have been in the same family for generations may have systems that haven't been serviced in many years, if ever. While these systems may have survived on the favorable side of luck for a long time, a professional evaluation can reveal whether that luck is running out.\n\nThe recent wave of development interest in Taylor, driven by new employers and affordable housing relative to Austin, is also bringing new construction into areas that haven't seen residential growth in decades. These new homes typically install aerobic treatment units or engineered systems designed for the local clay, but they still require regular professional maintenance that new homeowners don't always anticipate.\n\nTaylor's flat topography and heavy clay combine to create slow surface drainage across much of the area. This means that rainwater doesn't run off quickly, which keeps the soil around septic systems saturated for longer periods after storms. It's a compounding factor that makes proactive maintenance even more important here than in better-draining areas.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Taylor?",
      "answer": "Taylor's heavy blackland clay drains very slowly, making regular pumping essential. We recommend every two to three years for most households. Older systems with smaller tanks or properties that have added occupancy over the years may need even more frequent service. Consistent pumping is the single best thing you can do for a system in Taylor soil."
