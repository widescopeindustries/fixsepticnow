  "aboutSection": "Terrell sits along the I-20 corridor in Kaufman County, about 30 miles east of Dallas, in a zone where suburban growth is steadily transforming former agricultural land into residential neighborhoods. While some newer developments near town connect to municipal sewer, the bulk of Kaufman County properties outside city limits depend entirely on private septic systems.\n\nThe soil across the Terrell area is predominantly blackland clay, the same heavy, dark soil that runs through much of the Texas Blackland Prairie from San Antonio to the Red River. For septic systems, this clay is both a blessing and a curse. Its density helps contain contaminants, preventing them from reaching groundwater too quickly. But that same density means drain fields process effluent at a much slower rate than sandier soils, which increases the workload on the tank and makes the entire system more sensitive to heavy water use or delayed maintenance.\n\nKaufman County's seasonal weather patterns amplify these challenges. Spring rain events can saturate the clay for weeks, turning drain fields into soggy, non-functional areas. Summer drought then bakes the clay into hard, cracked ground that shifts tanks and stresses pipe joints. This annual cycle is the leading cause of premature system failure in the Terrell area.\n\nWe frequently encounter cracked baffles and tank walls in Terrell, often the result of clay movement over years. Drain field failures are common on properties where the system was installed without adequate soil testing or where homeowners unknowingly parked vehicles or placed structures over the leach area. Root intrusion from pecan and elm trees seeking moisture through the dense clay is another persistent problem. If your system is showing signs of trouble, whether it's slow drains, wet patches in the yard, or odors near the tank, getting it inspected now saves money compared to waiting for a complete failure.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Terrell?",
      "answer": "Every two to three years is smart for most Terrell homes because the heavy blackland clay limits how efficiently your drain field can do its job. Properties with smaller tanks or larger families may need annual or biannual service. Sandier pockets exist in parts of Kaufman County that may allow longer intervals. An inspection tells us exactly what your property needs."
