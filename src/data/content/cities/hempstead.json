  "aboutSection": "Hempstead sits at the intersection of US 290 and Highway 6 in Waller County, serving as a gateway between the Houston metro and the agricultural communities of the Brazos Valley. It's a town where land is measured in acres, not square feet, and where municipal sewer service ends a short distance from the courthouse. The vast majority of homes, ranches, and rural businesses in the Hempstead area depend on septic systems.\n\nThe sandy loam soil around Hempstead offers solid natural drainage, which makes it a relatively cooperative environment for conventional gravity-fed septic systems. Percolation rates are generally in a healthy range, and the soil filters effluent effectively before it reaches groundwater. Many of the older systems in the area have operated for decades on this foundation with minimal issues, assuming they've been maintained.\n\nThat maintenance piece is where things often get complicated in rural areas. Hempstead properties tend to be large, which means septic tanks may be far from the house and easy to forget about. Out of sight, out of mind is a real pattern in the country, and we frequently encounter systems that haven't been pumped in a decade or more. By that point, solids have often migrated into the drain field, requiring more than just a pump-out to restore function.\n\nThe agricultural character of the Hempstead area also introduces considerations around livestock grazing near drain fields, heavy equipment crossing distribution lines, and the use of septic systems at barns, workshops, and secondary structures that may have been added without proper system sizing. Properties near the Brazos River or its tributary creeks may also experience seasonal water table fluctuations that affect drain field performance.\n\nHempstead's position along US 290 has attracted some new residential development, bringing modern aerobic systems into an area more accustomed to old-school gravity setups. These newer systems require regular professional maintenance that rural property owners aren't always used to scheduling.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Hempstead?",
      "answer": "The sandy loam around Hempstead allows most conventional systems to run well on a three- to five-year pumping cycle. Properties with well water should stay closer to three years to protect their water supply. Homes with garbage disposals or higher-than-average occupancy may need more frequent service. We can inspect your system and recommend a tailored schedule."
