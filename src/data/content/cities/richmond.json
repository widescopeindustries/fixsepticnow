  "aboutSection": "Richmond sits along the Brazos River in the heart of Fort Bend County, an area where Texas history runs deep and development has accelerated dramatically over the past two decades. While newer master-planned communities in the surrounding area often connect to municipal utility district sewer systems, a large number of Richmond-area properties still rely on private septic systems. This is particularly true for older homes within the city, rural tracts along the river, and properties in unincorporated parts of the county.\n\nThe dominant soil type around Richmond is heavy clay, part of the expansive Beaumont clay formation that underlies much of the upper Texas Gulf Coast. This soil is dense, slow-draining, and prone to significant expansion and contraction with moisture changes. For septic systems, this translates to drain fields that struggle to absorb effluent at adequate rates, especially after rainfall. It also means the ground around tanks and pipes shifts seasonally, which can crack joints, tilt tanks, and displace distribution lines over time.\n\nRichmond's position along the Brazos adds another layer of complexity. The river corridor and its tributaries create areas of high water table, particularly during wet seasons and after upstream dam releases. Properties in the floodplain or near oxbow lakes face elevated groundwater that can reduce drain field effectiveness or, in extreme cases, flood the septic tank itself.\n\nCommon problems we address in the Richmond area include saturated drain fields that won't absorb, tank settlement in shifting clay, root intrusion from the large pecan and live oak trees that are characteristic of Brazos bottomland properties, and systems that were installed decades ago with minimal engineering for the soil conditions. Fort Bend County's growth has also led to situations where properties have been subdivided and existing septic systems are serving more demand than they were designed for. A professional evaluation can determine whether your system is keeping pace with your household's needs.",

    {
      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Richmond?",
      "answer": "Richmond septic pumping typically costs between $375 and $625. Heavy clay soil can make accessing buried lids more labor-intensive, and larger rural property tanks run toward the higher end. A standard 1,000-gallon residential tank usually costs $400 to $500 to pump. We provide a clear quote before any work starts."

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Richmond?",
      "answer": "Richmond's heavy clay soil and proximity to the Brazos River floodplain mean drain fields work under more stress than in sandier areas. We recommend pumping every two to three years for most households. Properties near the river or in lower-lying areas that experience seasonal high water should stay on the shorter end of that schedule."
