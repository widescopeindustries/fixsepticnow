  "aboutSection": "Wimberley is one of the most geologically sensitive communities in Texas when it comes to wastewater management. The town sits directly on the Edwards limestone formation, a karst landscape defined by thin soils, exposed rock, underground caverns, sinkholes, and fracture networks that can transmit water, and whatever it carries, directly into the aquifer with virtually no filtration. There is no municipal sewer system in Wimberley. Every home, business, and rental property in the area operates on a private septic system.\n\nThis geological reality makes proper septic maintenance in Wimberley more than a household chore. It's an environmental imperative. A leaking tank or failing drain field on karst terrain doesn't just create a mess in the yard; it can introduce bacteria, nitrates, and other contaminants into the groundwater that feeds Jacob's Well, the Blanco River, and private wells throughout the valley. The consequences of neglect here are broader and more serious than in areas with deeper, more filtering soils.\n\nMost Wimberley properties use aerobic treatment units with either spray distribution or drip irrigation, because conventional drain fields require soil depths that simply don't exist over most of the local limestone. These systems treat wastewater to a higher standard before dispersing it, which is essential given the minimal natural filtration the karst provides. But they also require regular professional maintenance: quarterly inspections, chlorine replenishment, pump checks, and spray head clearing.\n\nWimberley's popularity as a vacation and short-term rental destination adds another layer of septic stress. Properties that see heavy weekend occupancy or seasonal spikes in use can overwhelm systems designed for a typical household. Many rental property owners underestimate how quickly a packed weekend can fill a tank or overload an aerobic unit that hasn't been serviced recently.\n\nFlood events along the Blanco River, which have been catastrophic in recent memory, can also damage or inundate septic systems in the floodplain. Post-flood assessment and remediation should be handled by professionals who understand both the mechanical systems and the environmental sensitivity of the location.",

    {
      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Wimberley?",
      "answer": "Given Wimberley's karst limestone and the near-zero natural filtration it provides, we recommend pumping every two to three years. Properties used as vacation rentals or with higher-than-normal occupancy should pump annually. Aerobic systems need quarterly maintenance inspections year-round. Staying on schedule protects both your system and Wimberley's vulnerable groundwater."
