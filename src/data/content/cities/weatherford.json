  "aboutSection": "Weatherford serves as the Parker County seat and the commercial hub for a wide stretch of rural and semi-rural land west of the DFW metroplex. As Fort Worth's suburban reach extends westward, more families are settling on larger lots outside city sewer boundaries, making septic systems the standard for a growing number of Parker County residences.\n\nThe soil across the Weatherford area is a mix of sandy loam and clay, with the balance shifting depending on elevation and proximity to waterways like the Clear Fork of the Trinity River and its tributaries. Higher ground tends toward sandier soils with better natural drainage, which is favorable for conventional drain fields. Lower areas and floodplains often have heavier clay content that holds water and slows percolation. Many Weatherford properties actually have both soil types present within the same lot, which makes proper drain field placement critical during installation.\n\nParker County's climate swings between extended dry spells and heavy rain events, both of which stress septic systems differently. Drought causes clay to shrink and crack, potentially shifting tanks and breaking pipe connections. Heavy rains saturate the soil and raise water tables, reducing the drain field's ability to absorb effluent. These cycles accelerate wear on every component of the system.\n\nCommon issues in the Weatherford area include root intrusion from post oak and mesquite trees that characterize the Cross Timbers landscape, failed lift station pumps on properties with elevation changes, and drain field saturation after storms. Older homes on the outskirts of town sometimes have septic systems that were designed decades ago for smaller households and are now undersized for modern water use. Regular pumping and periodic inspections are the most cost-effective way to catch problems before they turn into emergencies.",
  "whyChooseSection": "Parker County's mix of sandy loam uplands and clay bottomlands requires a septic team that reads the soil before recommending a fix. We've worked enough Weatherford properties to know where the sandy pockets drain fast and where the clay holds water all winter. That means fewer misdiagnoses and repairs that actually last. Our crews reach most Weatherford addresses within an hour, and our round-the-clock availability means a Sunday morning emergency gets the same response as a weekday appointment. Fully licensed, insured, and equipped for everything from routine pumping to complete system installations, Fix Septic Now is your call at (936) 292-2926.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Weatherford?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years works for most Weatherford homes on sandy loam. If your property sits on heavier clay, especially in lower-lying areas of Parker County, you may need pumping every two to three years because the soil processes effluent more slowly. Household size and water habits also play a role. We can assess your system and set the right schedule."
