  "aboutSection": "New Braunfels has been one of the fastest-growing cities in Texas for over a decade, and that explosive growth has pushed development far beyond the reach of municipal sewer infrastructure. Subdivisions continue to spring up along the edges of Comal County, from the hills west of town toward Bulverde to the flatlands stretching east toward Seguin, and virtually all of them rely on septic systems.\n\nThe geology beneath New Braunfels presents a particular set of challenges for septic owners. Much of Comal County sits on limestone bedrock with a thin layer of clay topsoil, a combination that can make drain field installation tricky and long-term performance unpredictable. Limestone is fractured and porous in some areas, allowing effluent to move too quickly into the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone without adequate filtration. In other spots, dense clay over impermeable rock creates the opposite problem: water pools instead of draining, overwhelming the leach field during wet weather.\n\nBecause New Braunfels sits within the Edwards Aquifer contributing and recharge zones, septic system maintenance here carries environmental weight beyond just protecting your property. A failing system can contribute contaminants to the aquifer that supplies drinking water to much of central Texas. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has specific regulations for septic systems in this region, and staying on top of pumping and maintenance helps you remain compliant.\n\nCommon issues we encounter in the New Braunfels area include shallow bedrock limiting drain field depth, root intrusion from cedar and live oak trees that thrive in the Hill Country, and seasonal flooding along the Comal and Guadalupe river corridors that can temporarily submerge low-lying drain fields. Older homes in the Gruene and downtown areas sometimes have systems that were designed for smaller households and now struggle under modern water usage. If you're seeing standing water over your drain field, smelling sewage near the tank, or dealing with persistent slow drains, it's time for a professional evaluation.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in New Braunfels?",
      "answer": "Every three to four years works for most New Braunfels households. However, the limestone and clay soils in Comal County can limit drain field efficiency, which means some systems build up solids faster than average. Homes on shallow bedrock or heavy clay should consider pumping every two to three years. We can inspect your system and tailor a schedule based on your soil conditions and household size."
