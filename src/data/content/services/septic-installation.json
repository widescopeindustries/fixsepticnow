  "whatIsSection": "Septic system installation is the process of designing and building a complete wastewater treatment system for properties that don't connect to a municipal sewer line. In Texas, this is governed by TCEQ regulations and administered through local authorized agents, and the process involves several critical steps that must be done correctly to protect your health, your property value, and the environment.\n\nThe process begins with a site evaluation. We assess your property's soil conditions, topography, available space, water table depth, and proximity to wells, property lines, and flood zones. In Texas, soil type is one of the most important factors in system design. Heavy clay soils found across Central Texas, the DFW metroplex, and much of East Texas often require alternative systems like aerobic treatment units because conventional drain fields can't percolate effluent fast enough. Sandy soils along the Gulf Coast drain quickly but may need additional treatment to protect shallow groundwater.\n\nBased on the site evaluation, we design a system matched to your property and household needs. Texas recognizes several system types: conventional gravity systems with drain fields are the simplest and most affordable where soil conditions allow. Aerobic treatment units use oxygen to break down waste more thoroughly and are required in areas with poor soil or limited space. Low-pressure dosing systems distribute effluent evenly across the drain field using a pump. Drip irrigation systems are used in challenging sites where other options aren't feasible.\n\nOnce the design is approved and permits are secured, installation typically takes 3 to 7 days depending on system complexity. We excavate for the tank, lay pipe from the house, install the distribution system, construct the drain field or treatment area, and connect all components. After installation, we schedule the required inspections and walk you through your new system's operation and maintenance requirements.",
  "signsSection": "There are several situations that call for a new septic system installation rather than repairing what's there.\n\nNew construction on a property without sewer access is the most straightforward reason. If you're building a home, shop with living quarters, or any structure with plumbing in an area without municipal sewer, you need a septic system designed and installed before you can get a certificate of occupancy.\n\nYour existing system has failed beyond repair. When a tank has catastrophic structural failure, or a drain field is completely saturated and the soil can no longer absorb effluent, replacement is often more practical and cost-effective than attempting repairs on a system that's reached the end of its lifespan.\n\nYour home has expanded significantly. Adding bedrooms, bathrooms, or converting a property to higher occupancy may require a larger system than what's currently installed. Texas sizing requirements are based on the number of bedrooms and expected daily water usage.\n\nYou're converting a property's use — turning a weekend cabin into a full-time residence, or developing a rural commercial property — and the existing system isn't adequate or doesn't exist.\n\nYour system doesn't meet current Texas regulations. Older systems installed before modern TCEQ standards may need to be replaced to comply with current requirements, especially during property transfers.",
  "processSection": "Fix Septic Now handles your installation from start to finish. We begin with a site evaluation — assessing soil conditions, topography, available space, and setback requirements. A licensed site evaluator performs soil testing to determine the right system type for your property. We design the system, prepare permit applications, and submit to the local authorized agent for approval. Once permitted, our crew excavates the site, sets the tank, lays all piping, installs the distribution system, and constructs the drain field or treatment area. We schedule and pass all required inspections. Before we leave, we walk you through your new system — how it works, what to do and what to avoid, and when to schedule maintenance. The entire process from site evaluation to completed installation typically takes 2 to 4 weeks.",
  "pricingSection": "New septic system installation in Texas ranges from $5,000 to $15,000 or more. A conventional gravity system on a straightforward site runs $5,000 to $8,000. Aerobic treatment units — required in many Texas locations with clay soil — typically cost $8,000 to $13,000. Advanced systems like drip irrigation on difficult sites can exceed $15,000. Costs are influenced by soil type, system design, excavation conditions, and permit requirements. We provide a detailed written estimate after your site evaluation.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to install a new septic system in Texas?",
      "answer": "The physical installation typically takes 3 to 7 days depending on the system type and site conditions. However, the full timeline from initial site evaluation through permits, installation, and final inspection usually runs 2 to 4 weeks. Permitting timelines vary by county — some process applications in a week, others take two to three weeks. We manage the entire process and keep you updated at every step."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of septic system do I need for my Texas property?",
      "answer": "It depends primarily on your soil conditions and available space. Properties with well-draining sandy or loamy soil and adequate room may use a conventional gravity system — the most affordable option. Heavy clay soil, high water tables, small lots, or proximity to waterways often require an aerobic treatment unit or drip irrigation system. We determine the right fit during the site evaluation and soil testing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit to install a septic system in Texas?",
      "answer": "Yes, all new septic system installations in Texas require a permit. Permits are issued through your county's authorized agent or directly through TCEQ. The permitting process includes a site evaluation, soil analysis, and system design review. We handle the entire permitting process for you as part of our installation service, so you don't have to navigate the paperwork yourself."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know what size septic system I need?",
      "answer": "In Texas, septic system sizing is based primarily on the number of bedrooms in your home, which serves as a proxy for the number of occupants and expected daily wastewater volume. A three-bedroom home typically requires a 1,000-gallon tank with a correspondingly sized drain field. We calculate the exact requirements based on your home's specifications and local regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you install a septic system in heavy clay soil?",
      "answer": "Yes, but it typically requires an alternative system rather than a conventional drain field. Heavy clay soil — common throughout Central Texas, DFW, and East Texas — doesn't percolate water well enough for standard gravity systems. Aerobic treatment units, drip irrigation systems, or low-pressure dosing systems are designed to work effectively in clay. We evaluate your specific soil conditions and design accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance will my new septic system need?",
      "answer": "Conventional systems need the tank pumped every 3 to 5 years and periodic inspections. Aerobic systems require more attention — the air pump, spray heads, and chlorination system need checking every 4 to 6 months, and most Texas counties require a maintenance contract with a licensed provider. We offer maintenance plans for all system types and walk you through your specific requirements at installation."
