  "whatIsSection": "A septic inspection is a professional evaluation of your entire septic system to determine its current condition, identify existing problems, and flag potential issues before they become expensive failures. It's one of the smartest investments a homeowner or property buyer can make.\n\nThere are different levels of inspection depending on your needs. A basic visual inspection includes locating the tank, checking the access lids and risers, measuring sludge and scum levels, inspecting baffles and filters, and verifying that effluent is flowing to the drain field. This level of inspection is suitable for routine maintenance checks and gives a solid overview of system health.\n\nA full inspection — often requested for real estate transactions — adds pumping the tank for a thorough interior assessment, checking for cracks, corrosion, and structural damage, inspecting pipe connections, evaluating the distribution box, and performing a drain field assessment including probing for saturation, checking for surfacing effluent, and noting any signs of failure.\n\nIn Texas, there's no state law requiring a septic inspection before a home sale, but many lenders require one, and any savvy buyer should insist on it. A failed septic system can cost $10,000 to $30,000 to replace — far more than the cost of an inspection. For sellers, having a clean inspection report removes a common obstacle from the closing process.\n\nTexas-specific factors we evaluate include soil type and its impact on drain field longevity, compliance with current TCEQ and local health department regulations, age and material of the tank relative to Texas environmental conditions, and whether the system is appropriately sized for the home and household. Our inspection reports are detailed, written in plain language, and accepted by real estate professionals and lenders throughout Texas.",
  "signsSection": "You don't have to wait for something to go wrong to get an inspection. Here are the most common — and smartest — reasons to schedule one.\n\nBuying a home with a septic system is the number one reason for an inspection. You need to know if the system works, how old it is, when it was last serviced, and whether it meets current regulations. Skipping this step has cost Texas home buyers tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nSelling your home is another key time. A clean inspection report gives buyers confidence, speeds up the closing process, and prevents last-minute deal-breakers.\n\nYou've never had the system inspected since moving in. If you bought the home without an inspection or inherited the property, you should know what you're working with before a surprise failure.\n\nYou're noticing early warning signs — occasional slow drains, faint odors, slightly soft ground over the drain field — that aren't severe enough for emergency service but suggest something may be developing.\n\nYour system is 15 or more years old. Older systems in Texas face increasing risk of tank deterioration, baffle failure, and drain field decline. An inspection establishes a baseline and helps you plan maintenance proactively.",
  "processSection": "When you schedule an inspection with Fix Septic Now, our licensed technician arrives with the tools and knowledge to evaluate your system completely. We locate the tank, uncover the access lids, and measure sludge and scum layers. We inspect the tank interior — walls, floor, baffles, and pipe connections — looking for cracks, corrosion, root intrusion, and structural concerns. We check the effluent filter if one is installed. For full inspections, we pump the tank for a thorough interior assessment, inspect the distribution box, and evaluate drain field condition. After the inspection, we sit down with you and explain exactly what we found — good and bad — in plain language. You receive a written report documenting the system's condition, any issues identified, and our recommendations.",
  "pricingSection": "Septic inspections in Texas typically cost between $200 and $500. A basic visual inspection with sludge level measurement falls at the lower end. A full inspection with pumping, interior assessment, and drain field evaluation runs toward the upper end. Real estate transaction inspections with a detailed written report are generally $350 to $500. We quote your specific inspection upfront with no hidden fees. Call (936) 292-2926 to schedule.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is a septic inspection required when buying a home in Texas?",
      "answer": "Texas doesn't have a state law mandating septic inspections for home sales, but many mortgage lenders require one, especially for FHA and VA loans. Even if your lender doesn't require it, we strongly recommend getting one before closing. A failing septic system can cost $10,000 to $30,000 to replace, and that's a risk no buyer should take on blindly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a septic inspection take?",
      "answer": "A basic visual inspection typically takes 1 to 2 hours. A full inspection that includes pumping the tank and evaluating the drain field may take 2 to 3 hours. The timeline depends on how easy the tank is to locate and access, the system's complexity, and whether any issues require additional investigation. We schedule enough time to be thorough."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the inspection report include?",
      "answer": "Our report documents the tank location, size, material, and approximate age. It covers sludge and scum levels, the condition of baffles, filters, and pipe connections, and any cracks, corrosion, or structural damage found. For full inspections, it includes drain field condition and distribution box assessment. We note all deficiencies, rate the overall system condition, and provide specific maintenance or repair recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you inspect a septic system I'm buying if no one knows where the tank is?",
      "answer": "Yes. Locating buried septic tanks is a routine part of our work. We use a combination of property records, as-built drawings when available, visual ground indicators, and electronic locating equipment. In most cases we can find the tank and complete the inspection in a single visit. If records exist at the county level, we can pull those ahead of time to speed things up."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a septic inspection and a home inspection?",
      "answer": "A general home inspector typically does a very surface-level check of the septic system — running water and flushing toilets to see if anything backs up. They usually don't open the tank, measure sludge levels, or evaluate the drain field. A dedicated septic inspection by a licensed septic professional provides a far more thorough and reliable assessment of the system's true condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I get my septic system inspected?",
      "answer": "We recommend a basic inspection every 1 to 3 years for routine maintenance monitoring, and a full inspection any time you're buying or selling a property. If your system is over 15 years old, annual inspections are a smart investment. Regular inspections catch small problems early before they turn into major repairs, potentially saving you thousands of dollars."
