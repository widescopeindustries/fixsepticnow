  "whatIsSection": "Septic maintenance is the routine care that keeps your system functioning properly, extends its lifespan, and prevents the kind of failures that lead to expensive emergency repairs. It's the difference between proactive care and reactive panic.\n\nFor conventional gravity systems, maintenance primarily involves regular inspections and periodic pumping. During a maintenance visit, we measure sludge and scum levels in the tank to determine if pumping is needed, inspect baffles and effluent filters, check inlet and outlet pipes for blockages or damage, evaluate the drain field for signs of stress or early failure, and document everything so you have a clear service history.\n\nAerobic treatment units — which are increasingly common in Texas due to the state's widespread clay soils — require more frequent and involved maintenance. Texas regulations actually mandate that aerobic systems have an active maintenance contract with a licensed provider. During aerobic system maintenance, we check the air pump or compressor, inspect spray heads or drip lines, verify chlorination or UV disinfection systems are working properly, test effluent quality, check alarms and floats, and ensure the system meets TCEQ discharge standards.\n\nTexas climate makes maintenance especially important. Extended summer heat accelerates biological processes in your tank, which can increase sludge accumulation faster than the national average. Seasonal rainfall extremes — from drought to flood — stress drain fields and can reveal weaknesses in systems that aren't regularly monitored. Clay soil expansion and contraction throughout the year puts mechanical stress on tanks and pipe connections that a trained eye can spot before they become failures.\n\nA good maintenance schedule turns your septic system from a ticking time bomb into a reliable, long-lasting piece of infrastructure. Most well-maintained conventional systems last 25 to 30 years or more. Neglected systems often fail in half that time.",
  "signsSection": "You don't need warning signs to start a maintenance plan — in fact, the best time to start is before any signs appear. But here are situations that tell you maintenance is overdue.\n\nYou have no idea when your tank was last pumped or inspected. If you can't remember or don't have records, your system is overdue for a professional evaluation at minimum.\n\nYou bought your home without a septic inspection and have never had the system serviced since moving in. You're operating blind, and a baseline maintenance visit establishes what you're working with.\n\nYour aerobic system doesn't have an active maintenance contract. In Texas, this is actually a regulatory requirement, and operating without one can result in fines and complications during property sales.\n\nYou're noticing minor but recurring issues — occasional slow drains, faint odors that come and go, a drain field that seems slightly softer than it used to. These subtle signs are your system asking for attention before it demands it.\n\nYour system is more than 10 years old and has never been on a regular maintenance schedule. Older systems benefit the most from proactive monitoring, as components begin to wear and small issues become more likely.",
  "processSection": "Setting up maintenance with Fix Septic Now is straightforward. We start with an initial evaluation of your system — locating and inspecting the tank, checking all components, measuring sludge levels, and assessing drain field condition. Based on what we find, we recommend a maintenance schedule tailored to your system type, household size, and current condition. For conventional systems, that's typically an annual inspection with pumping every 3 to 5 years. For aerobic systems, we schedule visits every 4 to 6 months as Texas regulations require. We handle scheduling and send you reminders when service is coming due. After every visit, you receive a written report documenting what we checked, what we found, and any recommendations. No surprises, no forgotten appointments, no lapsed compliance.",
  "pricingSection": "Annual septic maintenance plans in Texas typically run $200 to $400 per year depending on your system type and the services included. Conventional system plans at the lower end include annual inspection and sludge measurement, with pumping quoted separately when needed. Aerobic system plans are higher because they include the multiple annual visits Texas requires. Compare that to average emergency repair costs of $1,500 to $5,000 and it's easy math. We outline exactly what's included in your plan before you commit. Call (936) 292-2926 to get started.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is a maintenance contract required for my septic system in Texas?",
      "answer": "For aerobic treatment units, yes — Texas regulations require an active maintenance contract with a licensed provider. The system must be inspected and serviced multiple times per year, and the maintenance provider reports to the local authorized agent. Conventional gravity systems don't have a legal maintenance requirement, but regular maintenance is strongly recommended to protect your investment and avoid costly failures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a typical maintenance visit include?",
      "answer": "For conventional systems, we measure sludge and scum levels, inspect baffles and filters, check pipe connections, evaluate drain field condition, and document everything. For aerobic systems, we additionally check the air pump or compressor, inspect spray heads or drip lines, verify chlorination or UV disinfection, test effluent quality, and ensure alarm and float switches are functioning. We provide a written report after every visit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much money does regular maintenance actually save?",
      "answer": "A well-maintained septic system can last 25 to 30 years. A neglected one often fails in 10 to 15 years. Drain field replacement alone costs $10,000 to $20,000 in Texas. At $200 to $400 per year for maintenance, you're spending $2,000 to $4,000 per decade to potentially avoid a $15,000 or more replacement. Most homeowners find that maintenance pays for itself many times over."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do septic maintenance myself?",
      "answer": "You can do some things — like conserving water, avoiding flushing harmful materials, keeping vehicles off the drain field, and monitoring for warning signs. But the technical aspects — measuring sludge levels, inspecting baffles, checking mechanical components, and evaluating drain field performance — require professional equipment and training. For aerobic systems, Texas law requires a licensed maintenance provider."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I avoid putting in my septic system?",
      "answer": "The big ones: no grease or cooking oil, no wipes (even ones labeled flushable), no feminine hygiene products, no paint or chemicals, no medications, and no excessive amounts of household cleaners. These items either clog pipes, kill the beneficial bacteria your tank needs to function, or accumulate in ways that accelerate the need for pumping. Stick to human waste and toilet paper only."

      "question": "How do I sign up for a maintenance plan?",
      "answer": "Call us at (936) 292-2926 or request a callback through our website. We'll start with an initial evaluation of your system to understand what you have and what it needs. Then we'll recommend a plan that fits your system type and budget, with clear pricing and a schedule for service visits. There are no long-term contracts — you can cancel anytime, though most customers stay because the value is obvious."
