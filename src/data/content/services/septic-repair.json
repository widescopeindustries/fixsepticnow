  "whatIsSection": "Septic system repair covers a wide range of work, from replacing a single cracked baffle to rebuilding major components of your entire system. The key is accurate diagnosis — many septic problems share similar symptoms, and fixing the wrong thing wastes your money and leaves the real issue unresolved.\n\nThe most common repairs we perform in Texas include cracked or deteriorating tank walls, damaged or missing baffles, broken inlet or outlet pipes, failed effluent filters, collapsed distribution boxes, and compromised drain field lines. Older concrete tanks are especially prone to corrosion from hydrogen sulfide gas, which eats away at the concrete over years. We see this frequently in tanks that are 20 or more years old across the state.\n\nTexas soil and climate conditions create unique repair challenges. Expansive clay soils — prevalent from San Antonio through Dallas and into East Texas — shift with moisture changes, putting stress on rigid concrete tanks and pipe connections. This soil movement is one of the leading causes of cracked tanks and broken pipes in the state. During drought cycles, clay soils shrink and pull away from the tank, then swell and press against it when rains return. That repeated stress eventually causes structural failure.\n\nDrain field repairs are among the most involved and expensive septic work. When a drain field fails because of soil saturation, biomat buildup, or compaction, the affected lines or the entire field may need replacement. In some Texas counties, drain field repairs require permits and inspections through the local authorized agent or TCEQ.\n\nOur approach starts with a thorough diagnostic evaluation. We pump and inspect the tank, camera-inspect pipes when needed, check the distribution box, and evaluate drain field performance. Only after we understand exactly what's wrong do we present you with repair options and transparent pricing.",
  "signsSection": "Septic system problems rarely fix themselves — and the longer you wait, the more expensive the repair becomes. Watch for these warning signs.\n\nSewage backing up into your home through drains, toilets, or tubs is the most obvious sign of a serious problem. This could mean a full tank, but if pumping doesn't resolve it, you're looking at a pipe blockage, failed baffle, or drain field failure.\n\nPersistent wet or soggy areas over your drain field, especially when it hasn't rained, indicate the field is not absorbing effluent properly. You may also notice a sewage odor in that area.\n\nSinkholes or depressions in your yard near the septic tank suggest the tank lid, riser, or tank itself may be collapsing — a safety hazard that needs immediate attention.\n\nAlarms going off on aerobic systems or pump tanks mean a mechanical component has failed or water levels are abnormally high.\n\nNitrate or coliform contamination showing up in a well water test can indicate your septic system is leaking untreated waste into the groundwater — a serious health and environmental concern that requires prompt repair.",
  "processSection": "Fix Septic Now takes a diagnostic-first approach to every repair. We start by pumping the tank and performing a thorough inspection of the interior — walls, floor, baffles, and pipe connections. If needed, we camera-inspect the lines between your house and the tank, and from the tank to the drain field. We check the distribution box and evaluate drain field performance through visual inspection and, when necessary, probing. Once we've identified the problem, we walk you through exactly what's wrong, what needs to be repaired, your options, and the cost for each. We only proceed with your approval. Our technicians carry common repair parts on our trucks, so many fixes are completed the same day. For larger projects, we schedule promptly and keep you informed throughout.",
  "pricingSection": "Septic repair costs in Texas vary widely based on what's broken. Minor repairs like baffle replacement or effluent filter installation typically run $500 to $1,000. Tank repairs including patching cracks or replacing risers and lids range from $1,000 to $2,500. Drain field repairs or replacements can run $3,000 to $10,000 or more. We diagnose first and give you a clear, written quote before any repair begins. No pressure, no surprise charges. Call (936) 292-2926 for a free evaluation.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my septic tank needs repair or replacement?",
      "answer": "It depends on the type and extent of damage. A tank with a single crack or failed baffles can usually be repaired cost-effectively. But if the tank has widespread structural deterioration, multiple large cracks, or is severely corroded, replacement is often the better long-term investment. We assess the full picture during our inspection and give you honest advice — we won't push replacement when a repair will do the job."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you repair a septic tank without digging up my yard?",
      "answer": "For many tank-level repairs — like baffle replacement, riser installation, or effluent filter work — we only need to access the tank through the lid, so yard disruption is minimal. Pipe repairs and drain field work do require excavation, but we limit the digging to what's necessary and restore the area when we're done."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a typical septic repair take?",
      "answer": "Minor repairs like baffles or filters can be completed in a few hours on the same day. Tank crack repairs usually take one day. Drain field repairs or replacements may take two to five days depending on the size of the system and soil conditions. We give you a realistic timeline before we start so you can plan accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a permit for septic repairs in Texas?",
      "answer": "It depends on the scope of work and your county. Minor component repairs like baffle or filter replacement generally don't require permits. However, drain field repairs, tank replacement, or system modifications typically need permits through your county's designated agent or TCEQ. We handle the permitting process for you when it's required."
    },
    {
      "question": "My septic alarm keeps going off — what does that mean?",
      "answer": "A septic alarm indicates high water levels in your pump tank or aerobic treatment unit. Common causes include a failed pump, stuck float switch, clogged filter, or excessive water usage. It can also signal a drain field problem preventing proper outflow. Don't ignore it — high water levels can lead to backups. Call us and we'll diagnose the exact cause."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can tree roots damage my septic system?",
      "answer": "Yes, tree roots are one of the most common causes of septic damage in Texas. Roots seek out the moisture around pipes and tanks, and they can infiltrate pipe joints, crack tank walls, and clog drain field lines. We see root intrusion regularly, especially with older clay pipe connections. We can clear roots and repair the damage, and advise you on which trees to watch or remove."
