  "localRelevance": "Brenham's real estate market attracts buyers from both Houston and Austin, many of whom are unfamiliar with septic systems. A pre-purchase inspection protects these buyers from inheriting problems they cannot see and do not know to look for. Our inspectors explain findings in plain language and provide clear recommendations.\n\nWashington County's mixed soil means inspection findings vary by property location. Sandy loam areas may have drainfields functioning silently despite treatment quality issues, while clay areas may show surface symptoms of stress. Our inspectors evaluate both scenarios and test drainfield performance regardless of what the surface suggests.\n\nOlder Brenham properties sometimes have undocumented system modifications or additions from previous owners. Inspections reveal these changes and assess whether they affect system performance or code compliance. This information is critical for buyers negotiating purchase terms and for owners planning maintenance.\n\nBrenham's commercial properties, including restaurants and event venues, also benefit from periodic inspections that verify their systems can handle the higher demands of commercial operations. These inspections help business owners plan maintenance and avoid the emergencies that disrupt operations.",
