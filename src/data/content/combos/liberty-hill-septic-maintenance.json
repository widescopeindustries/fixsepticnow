Call (936) 292-2926 to start your Liberty Hill maintenance plan.",
  "localRelevance": "Liberty Hill's combination of sensitive geology and complex septic system types makes maintenance a non-negotiable requirement. The aerobic treatment units with spray or drip irrigation that most Liberty Hill properties use have significantly more mechanical components than conventional gravity systems. Aerators, pumps, chlorinators, spray heads or drip emitters, and electronic controls all require regular professional inspection and servicing to maintain the effluent quality that this sensitive limestone environment demands.\n\nWilliamson County requires maintenance contracts for all aerobic systems, making professional maintenance a legal obligation for most Liberty Hill homeowners. But the requirement exists for good reason. A malfunctioning aerator that goes undetected can reduce treatment quality dramatically, sending poorly treated effluent into the thin soil over limestone where it has minimal opportunity for natural remediation before reaching the rock substrate.\n\nMineral scale from Liberty Hill's hard well water is an ongoing maintenance concern. The calcium carbonate that characterizes Hill Country groundwater deposits progressively inside your tank and on system components. Left unaddressed, this buildup reduces tank capacity and impedes flow through the treatment process. Our maintenance visits monitor scale accumulation and recommend cleaning when levels warrant attention. The $300 to $400 annual cost of maintenance protects a system investment of $10,000 to $20,000 and safeguards the irreplaceable groundwater resources beneath Liberty Hill.",
