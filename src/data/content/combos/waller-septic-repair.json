  "localRelevance": "Waller's mixed soil conditions create a wider variety of repair issues than communities with uniform soil types. Properties on the sandy loam side experience erosion-related damage where soil washes away from pipes and tanks during heavy rains, causing settling and misalignment. Properties on the clay side deal with expansion-contraction forces that crack pipes and shift connections over time. Some Waller properties sit on the transition zone and experience both types of stress simultaneously.\n\nThe rural character of much of Waller County means many septic systems were installed for agricultural properties, ranch homes, and farmsteads. These systems may have been designed for lower occupancy levels and can become stressed when properties are converted to higher-density residential use. We frequently diagnose and repair systems that are showing signs of being under-sized for their current usage levels.\n\nLivestock and agricultural equipment add repair considerations specific to Waller. Heavy equipment driven over drain fields compacts soil and can crush distribution pipes. Livestock grazing over septic areas creates both compaction and direct physical damage to exposed components like aerobic spray heads and access risers. Our repair work in Waller addresses these agricultural-related damages alongside the standard soil-related and age-related repairs common to all septic systems.",
