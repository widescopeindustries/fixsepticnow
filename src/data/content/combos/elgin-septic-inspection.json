  "localRelevance": "Elgin's steady real estate growth as an Austin-area community makes septic inspections a frequent need. Properties along Highway 290 and in expanding residential areas change hands regularly, and buyers need reliable information about the septic systems they are inheriting.\n\nBastrop County's mixed soil profile means Elgin inspections must account for varying conditions. Properties with sandy loam may have drainfields that appear fine on the surface but are allowing inadequately treated effluent to reach groundwater. Properties with clay-heavy soil may show surface signs of drainfield stress that sandy loam properties would not. Our inspectors know what to look for in each soil type and test accordingly.\n\nOlder Elgin properties sometimes have limited or no documentation of their septic systems. Our inspectors locate tanks and drainfields using probes and electronic equipment, then assess the system's design, condition, and compliance with current standards. These findings are critical for buyers who need to budget for potential upgrades or repairs.\n\nRoutine inspections for existing Elgin homeowners help track system performance over time. By comparing sludge accumulation rates and drainfield behavior across visits, we can identify trends that suggest developing problems and recommend corrective action before a failure occurs.",

      "answer": "Elgin's mixed sandy loam and clay soil means inspectors must evaluate drainfield performance for both soil types. Sandy areas may mask problems that would be visible in clay, while clay areas may show stress that sandy soil would absorb. Our inspectors are trained to assess both conditions accurately."
