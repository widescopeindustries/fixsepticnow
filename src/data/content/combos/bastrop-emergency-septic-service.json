Whether raw sewage is backing up into your house, your yard is flooding with effluent, or your alarm is sounding on an aerobic system, our emergency crews are dispatched to Bastrop County day or night, weekends and holidays included.

  "localRelevance": "Emergency septic situations in Bastrop County require swift professional intervention due to the area's unique environmental conditions. The sandy loam soil that characterizes much of Bastrop drains quickly, meaning a septic overflow or pipe break can send contaminated water toward the water table or nearby surface water much faster than it would in heavy clay regions. Properties near the Colorado River, Alum Creek, or Pin Oak Creek face heightened risk of waterway contamination during a septic emergency. Bastrop experiences intense thunderstorms during spring and fall that can dump several inches of rain in hours. This sudden saturation overwhelms drain fields, causes tank flotation in shallow installations, and triggers backups into homes. Emergency response during these weather events is one of our most common calls in the Bastrop area. Power outages following storms also disable aerobic treatment unit blowers and effluent pumps, creating secondary emergencies that require generator support or manual intervention. The population growth in Bastrop has placed increasing pressure on aging septic infrastructure. Older systems in established neighborhoods near downtown or along Highway 21 may be operating beyond their designed capacity, making them more prone to sudden failures. New construction areas can experience emergency situations related to improper installation or systems that have not yet been fully commissioned. Fix Septic Now maintains emergency response capability for all of Bastrop County, including Cedar Creek, Elgin, Smithville, Red Rock, and McDade.",
