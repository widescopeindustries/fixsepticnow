  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides 24/7 emergency septic service for Weatherford and Parker County.

  "localRelevance": "Weatherford's position in the DFW metroplex exposes it to severe thunderstorms and the occasional tornado-producing system that can trigger multiple septic emergencies simultaneously. Heavy rain saturates clay soils and overwhelms drain fields, while the intensity of DFW-area storms can also cause erosion damage on sandy loam properties. Power outages during these events disable pump-dependent systems across Parker County. Rural Weatherford properties face emergency situations that may not be immediately apparent. A pipe break on a remote ranch may go unnoticed for hours until someone visits the area or notices a drop in system performance. The distance from town can also mean longer response times, making prompt communication even more important. Fix Septic Now maintains emergency response capability for all of Parker County, including the rural areas surrounding Weatherford. The community's growth has increased the number of septic systems and the potential for widespread emergencies during major weather events. Fix Septic Now responds to all emergency types throughout Weatherford and Parker County.",
