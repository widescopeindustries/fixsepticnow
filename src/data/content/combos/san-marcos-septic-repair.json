  "localRelevance": "San Marcos' position at the Balcones Escarpment creates a zone where limestone and clay interact, producing diverse repair needs across the community. Western San Marcos properties on limestone experience root intrusion from native vegetation, shallow-soil challenges, and potential for aquifer contamination through rock fractures. Eastern properties on blackland clay face expansion-pressure damage, slow drainage, and settling-related component failures. Repair in San Marcos must address the specific geological conditions at each property. The urgency of repairs in San Marcos is elevated by the environmental significance of the Edwards Aquifer and San Marcos Springs. Any septic leak on limestone has the potential to reach the aquifer through the fractured bedrock. This is not a theoretical risk; it is a documented pathway that makes timely professional repair an environmental imperative for the community. San Marcos' mix of permanent residents and student renters creates varied repair scenarios. Long-term homeowners may face age-related system deterioration, while rental properties may develop problems from overuse or neglected maintenance. Both situations require professional diagnosis and quality repair to restore safe, compliant operation. Fix Septic Now serves all property types with experienced repair crews throughout San Marcos and Hays County.",
