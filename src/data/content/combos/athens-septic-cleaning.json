  "localRelevance": "Athens's mixed sandy loam and clay soil means tank cleaning benefits different properties in different ways. On clay-heavy ground, a clean tank with maximum volume reduces pressure on slow-draining drainfields. On sandy loam, a clean tank ensures better treatment quality before effluent reaches the permeable ground and potentially the water table.\n\nHenderson County's connection to Cedar Creek Lake makes treatment quality a community concern. Lakeside and near-lake properties contribute to watershed health through the quality of their septic effluent. A clean tank with healthy bacterial activity produces superior treatment compared to a tank operating below capacity due to internal buildup.\n\nAthens restaurants and food service businesses along the downtown square and Highway 175 generate grease-heavy wastewater that coats tank interiors aggressively. Professional cleaning is essential for these commercial operations to prevent grease from reaching drainfields where it causes permanent clogging.\n\nOlder Athens homes with concrete tanks benefit from cleaning that restores capacity lost to decades of residue accumulation. We document conditions during cleaning, giving homeowners clear information about their system's structural health.",
