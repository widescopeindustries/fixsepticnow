  "localRelevance": "Septic inspections in Hempstead address the dual concerns of system function and well water protection that define the rural Waller County experience. Our inspections include well-to-septic setback measurement and assessment of contamination risk, giving property owners confidence that their drinking water is protected.\n\nMany Hempstead properties have older systems with limited or no documentation. The septic system may have been installed by a previous owner decades ago without formal permits or engineering. Our inspectors locate all system components, document their configuration and condition, and create a baseline record that informs future maintenance decisions. This documentation is especially valuable for properties changing hands.\n\nThe Hempstead real estate market includes everything from small residential lots to large ranches and farms. Each property type presents different inspection considerations. Residential inspections focus on household capacity and standard component condition. Agricultural property inspections additionally evaluate whether the system can handle higher usage volumes, assess impacts from livestock and equipment, and check for secondary waste inputs that may be stressing the system beyond its original design capacity.",
