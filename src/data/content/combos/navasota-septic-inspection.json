  "localRelevance": "Navasota's real estate market sees regular activity from buyers attracted to Grimes County's affordable land and proximity to Bryan-College Station. Septic inspections are essential for these transactions because many properties have older systems with limited documentation.\n\nThe sandy loam soil around Navasota makes inspections particularly important because failing drainfields may not show the classic surface symptoms visible in clay areas. Effluent from a compromised system can drain downward into groundwater rather than ponding at the surface. Professional hydraulic load testing during inspection reveals absorption problems that visual observation alone would miss.\n\nMany Navasota properties have wells in addition to septic systems, creating a direct link between septic performance and drinking water quality. Our inspections evaluate this relationship by checking system setbacks, drainfield orientation relative to well location, and overall treatment performance.\n\nFor existing homeowners, routine inspections between pumping visits provide valuable trending data about system health. We track sludge accumulation rates, drainfield behavior, and component condition over multiple visits to create a performance profile that optimizes maintenance scheduling and predicts future needs.",

If we find inadequate treatment or failing absorption, we flag the groundwater concern.
