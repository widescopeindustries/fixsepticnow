  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides reliable septic pumping to Georgetown and Williamson County, available 24 hours a day. Georgetown's blackland clay and limestone soil creates one of the most challenging dual-threat environments for septic systems in Central Texas. The heavy blackland clay expands and contracts dramatically with moisture changes, while underlying limestone restricts drain field depth. Regular pumping is essential to prevent overloading a system that already operates with tight margins in these demanding conditions. Our trucks serve all of Georgetown, from historic downtown to the Sun City community and the rural properties beyond. Call (936) 292-2926 for septic pumping in Georgetown, TX.",
  "localRelevance": "Georgetown sits where the Blackland Prairie meets the Texas Hill Country, creating a soil profile that combines the challenges of both regions. The blackland clay soil at the surface is among the most expansive in Texas, swelling significantly when wet and cracking deeply when dry. Beneath this clay, limestone bedrock limits the depth available for septic drain fields. This double challenge means Georgetown septic systems face both the mechanical stress of expanding clay and the treatment limitations of shallow bedrock.\n\nThe blackland clay component drains extremely slowly, keeping septic tanks at elevated liquid levels and giving solids limited settling time. This slow drainage means tanks reach their pumping threshold faster than in well-draining soils. When heavy rains saturate the clay, drain fields can shut down entirely because the impermeable clay refuses to accept additional moisture.\n\nGeorgetown's growth as a desirable Austin-area community has increased septic system density in areas outside the city's municipal sewer reach. Properties along the I-35 corridor, in the rural eastern sections, and in developments near the San Gabriel River rely on individual septic systems. The combination of blackland clay and limestone beneath these properties demands a more aggressive pumping schedule than standard guidelines suggest. We recommend pumping every 2 to 3 years for Georgetown properties to maintain safe system operation.",

      "question": "How much does septic pumping cost in Georgetown?",
      "answer": "Septic pumping in Georgetown typically costs between $300 and $600. Standard residential pump-outs run $350 to $500. Properties on steep terrain or with difficult access in rocky areas may cost toward the higher end. We provide clear upfront pricing before starting any work."

      "question": "How often should Georgetown septic tanks be pumped?",
      "answer": "Every 2 to 3 years is recommended for Georgetown properties. The blackland clay drains extremely slowly, keeping tanks fuller, and the underlying limestone limits treatment depth. This dual challenge means Georgetown systems need more frequent pumping than most standard guidelines suggest to maintain safe operation."

      "question": "Does Georgetown's blackland clay affect my septic system?",
      "answer": "Significantly. Blackland clay is one of the most expansive soil types in Texas. It swells when wet, shrinks when dry, and drains extremely slowly. These characteristics keep your tank fuller, stress buried components through movement, and limit drain field function. Regular pumping compensates for the reduced drainage capacity."
