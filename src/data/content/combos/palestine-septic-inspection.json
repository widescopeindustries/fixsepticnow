  "localRelevance": "Palestine's real estate market draws buyers attracted to the city's historic charm, affordable properties, and east Texas natural beauty. Many of these properties have septic systems that need professional evaluation before purchase.\n\nAnderson County's sandy loam soil presents a deceptive inspection environment. Failing drainfields may appear perfectly normal from the surface because effluent drains downward through the permeable ground rather than ponding. Only professional hydraulic load testing reveals whether the system is actually providing adequate treatment.\n\nOlder Palestine properties frequently have systems with limited documentation. Our inspectors locate and map components, determine system age and design, and assess condition comprehensively. This information is critical for buyers making one of the largest purchases of their lives.\n\nFor existing Palestine homeowners, routine inspections protect well water by verifying ongoing treatment quality. We recommend inspections every two to three years for properties where wells and septic systems coexist in the sandy loam soil.",
