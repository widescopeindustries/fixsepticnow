  "localRelevance": "Maintenance for Granbury properties should emphasize effluent quality monitoring because sandy loam provides a relatively fast pathway to groundwater and Lake Granbury. Properties near the lake benefit from more frequent maintenance visits to catch any decline in treatment performance before it affects water quality. Seasonal lake homes need maintenance that accounts for usage fluctuations. Pre-season checks verify the system is ready for heavy occupancy, and post-season evaluations assess any damage from heavy use. ATU owners must maintain TCEQ service contracts. Fix Septic Now offers flexible maintenance for all Granbury and Hood County systems.",

      "question": "Do lake homes in Granbury need extra maintenance?",
      "answer": "We recommend it. Lakeside proximity increases environmental stakes, and seasonal use patterns stress systems differently than steady occupancy. Semi-annual visits for conventional systems and quarterly for ATUs provide good protection for Granbury lake properties."

    {
      "question": "How does maintenance protect Lake Granbury?",
      "answer": "Maintained systems produce properly treated effluent that poses minimal risk to groundwater and the lake. Unmaintained systems can release contaminants that travel through sandy loam to the lake quickly. Regular service is every homeowner's contribution to protecting this community resource."
