  "localRelevance": "Maintenance in New Braunfels serves dual purposes: protecting your property investment and safeguarding the Comal Springs and Guadalupe River ecosystem. Every septic system that operates efficiently produces cleaner effluent that poses less risk to the aquifer and surface waters that sustain the community's quality of life and tourism economy. Regular maintenance is an act of environmental stewardship that also saves money. The variable geology across New Braunfels means maintenance needs differ by location. Properties on limestone require monitoring for signs that effluent may be reaching bedrock fractures. Clay-dominant lots need drain field performance evaluation to catch early saturation. Our technicians understand these differences and adapt their assessment to each property's specific geological context. Aerobic treatment units are common in the New Braunfels area due to environmental regulations. TCEQ requires these systems to have active maintenance contracts with quarterly professional visits. Our maintenance program satisfies all regulatory requirements while providing the hands-on monitoring that keeps these systems performing at their best. Hard water mineral buildup is a maintenance concern unique to the Hill Country. Regular filter cleaning and periodic inspection of distribution components prevent the calcium deposits common in Comal County water from restricting flow and degrading system performance. Fix Septic Now offers comprehensive maintenance for all system types throughout New Braunfels and Comal County.",

      "question": "Do vacation rental owners in New Braunfels need different maintenance?",
      "answer": "Rental properties benefit from more frequent maintenance due to higher peak usage and less predictable waste patterns. We recommend quarterly inspections for active rentals rather than the annual visits sufficient for owner-occupied homes. This prevents system overload during peak tourism season when repair scheduling is most difficult."
