  "localRelevance": "Boerne sits in the heart of the Texas Hill Country on limestone karst terrain that makes responsible septic management a community priority. Karst geology features interconnected fractures, caves, and solution channels that can transport contaminants directly to aquifers with virtually no natural filtration. A septic tank overdue for pumping can release solids and bacteria into this system, potentially reaching drinking water supplies miles away. Regular pumping is the single most effective measure homeowners can take to prevent groundwater contamination in this environment. The Cibolo Creek watershed that flows through Boerne depends on clean aquifer discharge to maintain its flow and water quality. Properties along the creek and its tributaries bear particular responsibility for septic system maintenance, as any contamination can reach surface water quickly through the karst system. Even properties on hilltops above the creek contribute to the same underground hydrological network. Boerne has grown significantly as a Hill Country destination, with luxury homes and ranch properties increasing the number of septic systems in the area. Many of these properties are on large lots with systems designed for specific soil and bedrock conditions found during installation. Maintaining the pumping schedule recommended for each system ensures these custom installations continue performing as designed. Fix Septic Now serves all of Boerne and Kendall County with professional septic pumping services.",

      "question": "Why is septic pumping critical in Boerne's karst terrain?",
      "answer": "Boerne's limestone karst contains fractures and underground channels that transport contamination directly to aquifers with no soil filtration. If solids escape an overfull tank and reach the karst system, they can contaminate drinking water supplies. Regular pumping keeps solids safely inside the tank and out of this sensitive geological system."

    {
      "question": "How often should Boerne homeowners pump their septic?",
      "answer": "We recommend pumping every two to four years in Boerne's karst environment, erring on the shorter side compared to areas with more protective soil. Properties with thin soil over fractured limestone should pump every two to three years. Your specific household size and system capacity also influence the ideal frequency."
