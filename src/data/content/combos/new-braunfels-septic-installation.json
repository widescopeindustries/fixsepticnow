  "localRelevance": "Septic installation in New Braunfels requires site-specific engineering because the limestone and clay geology varies significantly across short distances. A hilltop lot may have inches of soil over solid limestone, while a nearby valley property sits on feet of clay. Some lots transition between both conditions within the proposed system footprint. This variability demands thorough site evaluation and flexible design approaches that account for the actual conditions discovered during soil testing. Properties in the Edwards Aquifer contributing zone surrounding New Braunfels face additional regulatory requirements for septic installations. Advanced treatment systems that produce higher-quality effluent may be mandated based on proximity to sensitive recharge features. Our engineers are familiar with these regulations and design systems that meet environmental protection requirements while remaining cost-effective. The growth of New Braunfels has pushed development into the Hill Country terrain west and north of town where rocky slopes and limited soil depth challenge conventional system designs. These properties often require aerobic treatment units with surface application, drip irrigation systems, or mound construction to achieve adequate wastewater treatment. We specialize in these alternative technologies that turn challenging sites into buildable lots. Fix Septic Now provides complete installation services from initial consultation through final TCEQ inspection for all property types in New Braunfels and Comal County.",

      "answer": "Rocky hillside properties often require aerobic treatment units with drip or spray distribution. Valley properties with clay may support conventional systems with oversized drain fields. The right system depends entirely on your specific site conditions including soil depth, percolation rate, slope, and proximity to waterways. Soil testing determines the best option."
