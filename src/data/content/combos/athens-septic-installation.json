  "localRelevance": "Athens and Henderson County's variable soil profile means installation approaches differ across the area. Properties with sandy loam may qualify for cost-effective conventional gravity systems, while clay-heavy sites need engineered drainfield solutions. Properties near Cedar Creek Lake may require enhanced treatment systems to meet environmental protection standards.\n\nNew construction around Athens includes both residential homes and lake-oriented properties like vacation houses and rental cabins. Each has different design requirements. Residential installations are sized for consistent daily use, while seasonal properties need systems that handle intermittent heavy usage and idle periods.\n\nHenderson County permitting follows TCEQ guidelines with soil analysis requirements. Fix Septic Now handles all testing, design submission, and inspection coordination. Our experience with the area's mixed soil conditions helps us submit accurate designs that avoid permitting delays.\n\nEvery Athens installation considers the long-term environment. We plan for root management in wooded areas, select materials that tolerate clay movement where applicable, and ensure lakeside installations include appropriate environmental safeguards.",

      "question": "What type of system works best on Athens clay soil?",
      "answer": "Clay zones in Henderson County typically need low-pressure dosing systems, drip irrigation drainfields, or aerobic treatment units with surface application.
