  "localRelevance": "Septic inspections are particularly important in Bastrop County due to the area's sandy loam soil and rapid residential growth. Many new homebuyers relocating to Bastrop from areas served by municipal sewer may be unfamiliar with septic system ownership and the importance of pre-purchase inspections. A thorough inspection before closing can reveal hidden problems that cost thousands to repair, from cracked tank walls to failing drain fields. The sandy loam soil prevalent in Bastrop County can complicate visual inspection because surface signs of drain field failure may not appear until the problem is severe. Effluent that would pool on clay soils often percolates through sandy loam without leaving obvious wet spots, meaning a drain field can be failing internally while the yard looks perfectly normal. Professional inspection techniques including dye testing and hydraulic load testing are essential for accurate assessment in these soil conditions. Bastrop's real estate market has been active, with many older properties changing hands. Homes built decades ago may have systems that were never permitted under current TCEQ regulations or that have been modified without proper authorization. An inspection identifies these compliance issues before they become the new owner's expensive problem. Properties in flood-prone areas near the Colorado River also warrant careful inspection of tank elevation and drain field placement to ensure the system meets current flood safety standards. Fix Septic Now provides inspections for all system types throughout Bastrop County.",
