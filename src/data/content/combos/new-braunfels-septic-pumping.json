  "localRelevance": "New Braunfels straddles a geological transition in Comal County where Edwards Limestone meets the deeper clay deposits of the Blackland Prairie. This mix means septic systems across the community face varying challenges depending on exact location. Properties on the western and northern sides of town tend toward limestone with thin soil cover, where improperly managed waste can reach aquifer recharge zones through rock fractures. Eastern and southern properties have deeper clay that drains slowly and stresses drain fields. Both conditions demand regular pumping. The Comal Springs and Guadalupe River are among the most significant water resources in Texas, and contamination from poorly maintained septic systems threatens these irreplaceable features. New Braunfels homeowners who maintain regular pumping schedules contribute directly to protecting the spring-fed rivers that define their community's identity and economy. New Braunfels has experienced tremendous growth, especially in subdivisions along the corridors between the city and Canyon Lake. Many of these homes rely on septic systems serving lots that range from standard suburban to multi-acre tracts. Each requires a pumping schedule matched to household size and soil conditions. Fix Septic Now evaluates these factors during every service visit and provides tailored recommendations for each New Braunfels property.",
