  "localRelevance": "Seguin's position along the Guadalupe River makes the community susceptible to flooding events that trigger widespread septic emergencies. When the river rises, properties in the floodplain can experience tank inundation, drain field saturation, and mechanical component damage. Even properties outside the direct flood zone can be affected when heavy rains saturate the clay soil areas of town and prevent drain field absorption. The mixed soil types across Seguin mean emergencies present differently depending on location. Clay-area emergencies typically involve household backups from saturated drain fields that cannot absorb effluent during wet weather. Sandy-area emergencies may involve erosion that exposes or damages buried components, or rapid movement of sewage through permeable soil toward the water table. Both require fast professional intervention but different response strategies. Seguin's older infrastructure includes some septic systems that are decades old and operating beyond their designed life expectancy. These aging systems are prone to sudden failures that become emergencies without warning. A routine day can turn into a crisis when a corroded baffle collapses, a deteriorated pipe finally gives way, or a worn pump motor fails. Fix Septic Now maintains emergency readiness for all types of septic failures throughout Seguin and Guadalupe County.",
