  "localRelevance": "Azle's location on sandy loam soil near Eagle Mountain Lake creates an environment where septic pumping is directly tied to lake water quality and community health. Sandy loam provides good percolation for drain fields but offers less natural filtration than denser soils. This means any solids or bacteria that escape an overfull tank can travel through the soil column relatively quickly toward the water table and eventually toward the lake. Regular pumping keeps this barrier intact. Eagle Mountain Lake is a primary water supply reservoir for the Fort Worth area and a beloved recreation destination. The hundreds of septic systems surrounding the lake contribute to its water quality, for better or worse. Every homeowner who maintains a regular pumping schedule is actively protecting this shared resource. Azle has grown as a suburban community within the DFW metroplex, attracting residents who want lakeside or rural living with reasonable access to Fort Worth. Many new homeowners come from areas served by municipal sewer and may be unfamiliar with septic system requirements. Fix Septic Now helps educate Azle residents about the pumping schedules appropriate for their sandy loam soil and proximity to Eagle Mountain Lake.",

      "question": "How does my Azle septic system affect Eagle Mountain Lake?",
      "answer": "Sandy loam soil allows septic effluent to reach groundwater relatively quickly.

    {
      "question": "How often should Azle lakeside properties pump?",
      "answer": "Properties near Eagle Mountain Lake should pump every three years for added water quality protection. The sandy loam provides less natural filtration, so keeping your tank well below capacity is important. Homes further from the lake can follow the standard three to five year schedule based on household size."
