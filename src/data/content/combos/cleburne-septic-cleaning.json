  "localRelevance": "Cleburne's heavy blackland clay makes thorough tank cleaning an especially valuable investment. The clay's percolation rate is among the lowest in the DFW area, meaning your drain field has almost no reserve capacity. A tank with even modest buildup on its walls loses critical volume that directly translates to increased drain field stress. Deep cleaning recovers this lost capacity and maximizes the settling time effluent receives before reaching the unforgiving clay. Many Cleburne properties have older concrete tanks with roughened interior surfaces that trap buildup more aggressively than modern smooth tanks. Some of these systems have been pumped for years but never properly cleaned, accumulating layers of residual material that reduce effective volume by 15 to 20 percent. Professional jetting strips this accumulated material and restores the tank to its original capacity. The moderate hardness of Johnson County groundwater contributes to mineral deposits inside septic tanks over time. These calcium-based coatings compound the organic buildup, creating a stubborn composite layer that standard pumping cannot remove. Fix Septic Now's cleaning service addresses both organic and mineral deposits for complete tank restoration throughout Cleburne and Johnson County.",

      "question": "Why is maximum tank capacity so critical in Cleburne?",
      "answer": "Johnson County's heavy blackland clay drains at one of the lowest rates in the DFW area. Your drain field has almost zero reserve capacity. Any reduction in tank volume from buildup pushes more waste toward the drain field than the clay can handle, accelerating irreversible clogging. Maximum tank capacity equals maximum drain field protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should Cleburne tanks be deep cleaned?",
      "answer": "Every five to seven years for most homes, with routine pumping every three to four years in between. Homes with older concrete tanks, garbage disposals, or heavy water usage benefit from cleaning every four to five years given the extreme clay conditions."
