  "localRelevance": "Elgin's growth as a Highway 290 corridor community has created strong demand for new septic installations. Properties outside municipal sewer service areas need well-designed private systems, and Bastrop County's mixed soil profile requires property-specific engineering.\n\nThe key to a successful Elgin installation is accurate soil testing. We perform percolation tests and borings at multiple locations across your proposed drainfield area because sandy loam and clay can be found in close proximity on the same lot. This data determines whether a conventional gravity drainfield, a low-pressure dosing system, or an advanced treatment unit is the right fit.\n\nElgin's proximity to Austin has attracted both subdivision developers building multiple homes and individual buyers building custom homes on rural lots. We serve both markets, scaling our approach from standardized subdivision installations to fully custom systems for unique properties. Our experience with Bastrop County's specific requirements helps keep projects on schedule.\n\nEvery Elgin installation includes components selected for the local soil environment. We use quality tanks, durable pipe materials, and drainfield technology appropriate for your soil test results. Proper compaction, backfill procedures, and grading complete the installation to prevent settling issues that plague systems built with less attention to detail in mixed soil conditions.",

      "question": "What determines which septic system type I need in Elgin?",
      "answer": "Soil percolation test results are the primary factor. Sandy loam with good drainage may support conventional gravity systems. Clay-heavy soil requires engineered solutions like low-pressure dosing or drip irrigation. Lot size, setback distances, water table depth, and household size also influence the design."
