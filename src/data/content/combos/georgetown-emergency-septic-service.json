  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides 24/7 emergency septic service to Georgetown and Williamson County. Georgetown's blackland clay becomes virtually impermeable when saturated, shutting down drain fields completely and causing rapid tank overflow. The underlying limestone means any overflow has a short path to groundwater through fractured rock. This dual-threat geology makes Georgetown septic emergencies both more likely to occur and more consequential when they do. Our emergency team responds with urgency to contain contamination and protect your property. Call (936) 292-2926 immediately.",
  "localRelevance": "Georgetown faces a higher frequency and severity of septic emergencies than most communities due to its challenging blackland clay over limestone geology. When heavy rain saturates the blackland clay, the soil becomes essentially impermeable. Drain fields stop working entirely because the swollen clay refuses additional moisture. Tanks fill rapidly and overflow, sometimes into homes, sometimes onto the ground surface where the thin soil provides minimal barrier before waste reaches the fractured limestone below.\n\nThe San Gabriel River and its tributaries add flood risk for Georgetown properties in low-lying areas. High water events during Central Texas spring storms can inundate septic systems directly, overwhelming tanks with floodwater, depositing sediment in distribution lines, and damaging electrical components on aerobic systems. The blackland clay holds this flood moisture for days after the event passes, extending the period during which your system cannot function.\n\nGeorgetown's growing population has increased both the number of septic systems and the expectation for rapid emergency response. Many newer residents are first-time septic system owners who may not recognize the early warning signs that precede an emergency in blackland clay conditions. Our emergency team responds to all situations with the expertise and equipment to resolve Georgetown's most challenging septic crises.",

      "question": "Why are Georgetown septic emergencies especially serious?",
      "answer": "Georgetown's blackland clay becomes impermeable when wet, triggering drain field failure and tank overflow. The shallow limestone beneath means any overflow has a direct path to groundwater through rock fractures. This combination makes emergencies both more frequent due to clay saturation and more dangerous due to rapid groundwater contamination risk."

    {
