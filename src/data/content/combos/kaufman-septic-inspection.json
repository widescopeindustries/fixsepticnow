  "localRelevance": "The city of Kaufman and surrounding Kaufman County have seen steady property sales as the region benefits from eastward expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. Septic inspections are a standard part of most transactions involving properties with private systems, and in this blackland clay environment, they are especially important because soil conditions can mask serious problems.\n\nA drainfield that appears dry on the surface may be failing just below the clay cap, with effluent pooling in the gravel trenches unable to percolate further. Only a professional inspection with hydraulic load testing can reveal this condition. Similarly, the constant pressure of expansive clay on tanks and pipes creates hairline cracks that grow over time. Our camera inspections detect these issues before they become emergencies.\n\nKaufman County properties occasionally have unpermitted septic modifications or additions from previous owners. These can include extra bathroom connections, redirected greywater, or drainfield extensions that do not meet code. Our inspectors identify these issues and advise on what would be needed to bring the system into compliance.\n\nFor Kaufman homeowners not involved in a transaction, we recommend routine inspections every two to three years. These visits create a historical record of your system's performance that helps predict maintenance needs and optimize pumping schedules for the clay soil conditions on your specific property.",
