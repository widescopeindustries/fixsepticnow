  "localRelevance": "Azle's sandy loam offers favorable installation conditions compared to the heavy clay found in other DFW areas. Good percolation rates support conventional gravity drain fields on many properties, keeping costs reasonable. However, properties within certain distances of Eagle Mountain Lake may require enhanced treatment systems to meet water quality protection requirements. The lakeside terrain in Azle can present physical installation challenges. Steep lots, mature trees, and rocky outcrops near the lake require careful equipment placement and creative system layouts. Our installers have experience working in these conditions and design systems that fit the available space while meeting all performance and regulatory requirements. Fix Septic Now handles all installation types for Azle and Tarrant County properties.",

      "question": "Do Azle lake properties need special septic systems?",
      "answer": "Properties close to Eagle Mountain Lake may require aerobic treatment units or other enhanced systems to meet water quality protection requirements. The sandy loam's rapid drainage means effluent reaches groundwater quickly, so higher treatment quality compensates for reduced natural filtration near the water supply."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is sandy loam easier to install in than clay?",
      "answer": "Yes. Sandy loam is easier to excavate, provides better natural drainage, and generally supports more cost-effective system designs. Installation is typically faster and less expensive than in heavy clay. However, proper compaction and erosion prevention are important considerations in sandy soil."
