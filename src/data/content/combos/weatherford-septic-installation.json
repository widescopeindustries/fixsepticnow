  "localRelevance": "Installation in Weatherford benefits from the generally favorable drainage of sandy loam soil on many properties, but clay influence in other areas requires more careful engineering. Soil testing determines exactly where your property falls on this spectrum and drives system design. Properties with adequate sandy loam percolation can often use cost-effective conventional gravity systems, while clay-influenced lots may need oversized drain fields or alternative approaches. Parker County's mix of suburban lots and large acreage tracts creates diverse installation scenarios. Compact subdivision lots require space-efficient designs that fit primary and reserve drain fields within tighter boundaries. Ranch properties offer more space but may have varied soil conditions across the lot that must be mapped through comprehensive testing. Fix Septic Now handles all installation types throughout Weatherford and Parker County.",

      "question": "Does Weatherford's sandy loam make installation easier?",
      "answer": "Sandy loam is generally easier to excavate and provides better drainage for conventional drain fields, which reduces cost. However, not all Weatherford properties have sandy loam. Clay pockets and transitional zones require different approaches. Soil testing is essential to determine your specific lot's conditions."
