  "localRelevance": "Smithville's appeal as a small-town community within commuting distance of Austin drives steady real estate activity that makes septic inspections a regular need. Buyers purchasing rural properties in Bastrop County are often unfamiliar with septic systems and depend on thorough professional inspections to protect their investment.\n\nThe sandy loam soil in the Smithville area can be deceptive during casual observation. Because it drains well, a failing drainfield may not produce the obvious surface signs like standing water or soggy ground that are common in clay areas. Effluent from a failing system can drain downward into the groundwater instead of surfacing, making the problem invisible but potentially contaminating wells and waterways. Professional inspection is the only reliable way to detect this kind of hidden failure.\n\nSmithville properties near the Colorado River floodplain deserve special inspection attention. Periodic flooding can damage system components, introduce sediment into tanks, and alter soil conditions around drainfields. Our inspectors check for flood-related damage and verify that the system is functioning properly within current soil conditions.\n\nFor existing Smithville homeowners, we recommend inspections every two to three years between pumping visits. These regular evaluations build a performance history that helps optimize your maintenance schedule and catch developing issues at their most affordable repair stage.",

      "question": "Why can't I just look at my Smithville drainfield to see if it's working?",
      "answer": "In sandy loam soil, a failing drainfield often looks normal from the surface because effluent drains downward rather than ponding. The contamination reaches groundwater without any visible signs. Professional inspection with hydraulic load testing reveals problems that visual observation cannot detect."

      "question": "Do I need a septic inspection for a Smithville property near the river?",
      "answer": "We strongly recommend it. Properties near the Colorado River in Bastrop County face flood risks that can damage septic systems without obvious surface evidence.
