  "localRelevance": "Dripping Springs demands the most vigilant septic maintenance of any community in our service area due to the direct connection between system performance and aquifer health. With only inches of clay soil separating most septic systems from fractured limestone bedrock, any lapse in system function can result in aquifer contamination that affects wells and springs far beyond your property boundary.\n\nMost Dripping Springs properties have aerobic treatment units with spray or drip irrigation, which are mechanically complex systems with more components that need regular attention than conventional gravity systems. Aerators, pumps, chlorinators, spray heads, drip line emitters, and electronic controls all require professional inspection and servicing. A failed aerator that goes undetected for weeks can dramatically reduce effluent quality, sending poorly treated waste into the thin soil over limestone.\n\nHays County requires maintenance contracts for aerobic systems, and Fix Septic Now provides full-service maintenance for Dripping Springs properties. Our quarterly visits cover all mechanical components plus Hill Country-specific concerns like mineral scale monitoring from the calcium-rich well water and spray head performance verification. We also monitor effluent quality to ensure the treatment level remains adequate for the limited soil buffer. Annual maintenance investment of $300 to $400 is essential protection for a system that cost $10,000 to $20,000 to install and for the irreplaceable aquifer resources beneath your property.",
