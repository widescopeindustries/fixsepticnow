  "localRelevance": "Granbury's lakeside real estate market makes pre-purchase inspections particularly important. Properties near Lake Granbury carry water quality responsibilities, and an inspection evaluates whether the system provides adequate protection. The mix of year-round homes and seasonal lake properties means inspectors must evaluate both current condition and capacity for intended use patterns. Older properties near the historic square and along the original Granbury streets may have systems that predate current regulations. Seasonal cabins being converted to full-time residences need evaluation for capacity adequacy. Newer lakeside developments should be assessed for construction quality. Fix Septic Now adapts each inspection to the specific Granbury property's needs.",
