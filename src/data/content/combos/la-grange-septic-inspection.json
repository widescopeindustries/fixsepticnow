  "localRelevance": "La Grange's active real estate market drives consistent demand for septic inspections. Historic homes, rural properties, and newer developments all change hands in Fayette County, and each transaction involving a septic system benefits from professional evaluation.\n\nThe mixed sandy loam and clay soil around La Grange makes inspection findings location-dependent. Properties on sandy ground may have drainfields that function well but require verification of adequate treatment before effluent reaches groundwater. Clay-heavy properties need assessment of drainfield absorption capacity and signs of hydraulic stress. Our inspectors test for both conditions.\n\nLa Grange's Colorado River proximity adds an inspection dimension that other communities may not need. Properties in or near the floodplain benefit from inspections that specifically check for flood-related damage, including sediment in the tank, shifted components, and altered drainfield performance from soil deposition or erosion.\n\nMany older La Grange properties have systems with incomplete documentation. Our inspectors locate and map system components, assess their condition and code compliance, and provide buyers and owners with a clear understanding of what they have and what it might need. This information is invaluable for budgeting maintenance and planning any needed improvements.",
