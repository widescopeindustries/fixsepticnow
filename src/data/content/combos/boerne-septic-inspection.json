  "localRelevance": "Boerne's high-value real estate market makes pre-purchase septic inspections especially important. Properties in Kendall County can carry substantial price tags, and a failing septic system on karst terrain can cost tens of thousands to replace when advanced treatment systems are required. An inspection before purchase identifies these potential costs and allows informed decision-making. The karst terrain adds environmental dimensions to Boerne inspections that go beyond standard system evaluation. Inspectors must assess whether the system provides adequate groundwater protection given the site's specific geological features. Dye testing can reveal whether treated effluent is reaching bedrock fractures, and soil depth measurements verify that adequate treatment zone exists between the drain field and the limestone below. Many Boerne properties use aerobic treatment units or other advanced systems mandated by environmental regulations. These systems have more components that can fail and more regulatory requirements than conventional systems. A thorough inspection evaluates mechanical function, effluent quality, distribution system condition, and compliance status. Some Boerne properties have systems permitted under older regulations that may not meet current standards. An inspection flags these compliance gaps, which could affect property transfers or require system upgrades. Fix Septic Now provides detailed inspections for all system types across Boerne and Kendall County.",
