  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now delivers deep septic cleaning for Georgetown properties in Williamson County, available around the clock. Georgetown's blackland clay and limestone geology produces some of the most aggressive tank buildup in Central Texas. The slow-draining clay keeps waste in your tank longer, creating thick deposits, while calcium-rich water from the limestone aquifer adds heavy mineral scale to every interior surface. Our high-pressure cleaning removes all hardened material, restores baffle function, and returns your tank to full working capacity. In conditions this demanding, maximum tank capacity is essential. Call (936) 292-2926 for septic cleaning in Georgetown, TX.",
  "localRelevance": "Georgetown's dual soil challenge produces tank buildup that combines the worst characteristics of both clay and limestone environments. The blackland clay keeps effluent in the tank for extended periods, allowing waste to form exceptionally thick sludge layers and dense grease caps. Simultaneously, the calcium-rich water drawn from the limestone aquifer deposits mineral scale on every interior surface. The resulting composite buildup is among the most stubborn and capacity-reducing found anywhere in our service area.\n\nStandard pumping removes the liquid and loose material but leaves behind a significant volume of hardened deposits. In Georgetown's demanding conditions where the system already operates with tight margins, this lost capacity matters more than it would in an area with deep, well-draining soil. Professional cleaning reclaims this volume and ensures baffles can separate solids from liquid effectively.\n\nThe mineral scale from Georgetown's hard water deserves particular attention. Calcium carbonate deposits are extremely hard and bond tenaciously to concrete and PVC surfaces. Left unchecked for years, this scale can significantly obstruct inlet and outlet tees, reduce baffle clearances, and create rough surfaces that trap even more organic waste. Our cleaning equipment and techniques are specifically effective against the mineral-organic composite buildup that Georgetown tanks produce.",

      "question": "How much does septic cleaning cost in Georgetown?",
      "answer": "Septic cleaning in Georgetown ranges from $350 to $700. The combined clay and limestone conditions typically produce heavier buildup than average, so costs often fall in the $425 to $650 range for residential tanks. Tanks with severe mineral scale may require additional cleaning time. We assess conditions and provide pricing before starting."

      "question": "Why is Georgetown tank buildup so severe?",
      "answer": "Two factors combine: blackland clay drains slowly, keeping waste in the tank longer and producing thick deposits, while limestone-derived calcium in the water supply creates heavy mineral scale. These two types of buildup bond together into a composite deposit that is more aggressive and harder to remove than either type alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should Georgetown tanks be cleaned?",
      "answer": "Every 3 to 4 years is recommended given the heavy buildup that Georgetown's conditions produce. Combined with pumping every 2 to 3 years, this schedule maintains the tank capacity your system needs to function within safe margins. Properties with extremely hard water may benefit from cleaning every 2 to 3 years."
