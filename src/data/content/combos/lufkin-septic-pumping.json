  "localRelevance": "Lufkin is the largest city in Angelina County and the commercial hub of the deep east Texas timber region. The area's deep sandy loam soil offers some of the best natural drainage in the state, which benefits septic system operation but also means contamination travels faster when maintenance is neglected.\n\nAngelina County's forestry and timber economy means many properties sit on large rural lots surrounded by dense pine forest. These remote properties depend entirely on private septic systems and wells, creating a direct relationship between septic maintenance and drinking water quality.\n\nLufkin has a stable residential community with many homes dating from the mid-twentieth century. Older septic systems with smaller tanks fill faster with modern water usage. Regular pumping bridges the gap between these aging systems' capacity and current household demands.\n\nThe Angelina River and its tributaries flow through Angelina County, making groundwater protection important beyond individual property concerns. Fix Septic Now helps Lufkin homeowners protect both their personal water supply and the broader watershed through consistent pumping schedules matched to their property's specific conditions.",

      "question": "Why does deep sandy loam make pumping important in Lufkin?",
