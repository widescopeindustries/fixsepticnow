  "localRelevance": "Elgin's mixed soil conditions make thorough tank cleaning particularly valuable. On clay-heavy portions of Bastrop County, effluent moves slowly through the drainfield, keeping the tank fuller and allowing more time for deposits to form on interior surfaces. On sandier areas, the faster drainage means a clean tank is essential for proper primary treatment before effluent reaches the more permeable soil.\n\nElgin's famous sausage-making heritage and active food industry mean some properties in town have septic systems that handle high-grease wastewater. Grease is especially problematic in septic tanks because it floats and coats the tank walls and baffles with a thick layer that standard pumping cannot remove. Professional cleaning is the only effective way to address grease accumulation in these commercial systems.\n\nResidential properties in Elgin also benefit from periodic cleaning, especially older homes with concrete tanks. As concrete ages, its surface becomes rougher and more porous, trapping organic material in tiny crevices. This trapped waste produces hydrogen sulfide gas that gradually corrodes the concrete above the waterline, weakening the tank structure. Cleaning removes the source material and slows this corrosion process.\n\nWe recommend Elgin homeowners schedule cleaning every three to five years. Commercial properties with grease-heavy waste streams may need annual or semi-annual cleaning.",

      "question": "Is septic cleaning different from pumping in Elgin?",
      "answer": "Yes. Pumping removes liquids and loose solids. Cleaning adds high-pressure washing of tank walls, baffles, and pipe connections to remove hardened deposits. For Elgin properties with mixed sandy and clay soil, cleaning ensures maximum tank capacity regardless of which soil type surrounds your drainfield."

    {
      "question": "Do Elgin food businesses need special septic cleaning?",
      "answer": "Yes. Food processing and restaurant operations generate significantly more grease than residential use. This grease accumulates rapidly inside tanks and requires professional cleaning to remove. We recommend commercial kitchen properties in Elgin schedule cleaning at least annually in addition to regular grease trap maintenance."
