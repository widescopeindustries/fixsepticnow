  "localRelevance": "Weatherford's growing real estate market attracts buyers seeking the balance of DFW-area employment access and small-town Hill Country character. Many available properties rely on septic systems, making pre-purchase inspections essential for informed buying decisions. Parker County's variable soil means the inspector must evaluate different risks depending on the property's geological context. The mix of historic homes, newer subdivisions, and ranch properties creates diverse inspection scenarios. Downtown historic homes may have aging systems with limited documentation. Ranch properties may have systems designed for different use patterns than a modern household requires. New construction should be evaluated for proper sizing and installation quality.
