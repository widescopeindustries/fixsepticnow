  "localRelevance": "San Marcos occupies a geologically significant area where the Balcones Escarpment creates a transition from Hill Country limestone to Blackland Prairie clay. The San Marcos Springs, among the largest in Texas, emerge at this boundary and are fed by the Edwards Aquifer. Properties in the western and northern parts of San Marcos tend toward limestone, while eastern and southern areas feature deeper blackland clay. Both soil types demand regular pumping but for different reasons. Limestone areas provide little filtration between drain fields and the aquifer, while clay areas restrict drainage and stress drain field capacity. The environmental sensitivity of the San Marcos Springs and San Marcos River cannot be overstated. Several endangered species depend on the springs, and federal protection ensures that activities threatening water quality face scrutiny. Responsible septic system management through regular pumping is every homeowner's contribution to protecting these irreplaceable natural resources. San Marcos has grown rapidly as both a university town and a residential community. Student rental properties and permanent residences alike rely on septic systems that need regular attention. Rental properties may be at higher risk for neglect if landlords do not maintain consistent pumping schedules. Fix Septic Now serves all San Marcos property owners with reliable septic pumping throughout Hays County.",

      "question": "How does septic pumping protect the San Marcos Springs?",
      "answer": "The San Marcos Springs are fed by the Edwards Aquifer, which is recharged through the limestone beneath and around the city. Improperly managed septic waste can reach the aquifer through limestone fractures. Regular pumping keeps solids contained in your tank, preventing contamination that could affect the springs and their endangered species."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should San Marcos properties be pumped?",
      "answer": "Every three to five years for most homes, with properties on thin limestone soil closer to the three-year mark for additional aquifer protection. Rental properties with higher occupancy should pump every two to three years. Household size and system age also influence frequency. We recommend a schedule during each service visit."
