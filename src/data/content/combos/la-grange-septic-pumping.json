  "localRelevance": "La Grange is the county seat of Fayette County and sits in a region where sandy loam and clay soils create variable conditions for septic systems. The Colorado River's floodplain influences soil characteristics and groundwater levels throughout the area, adding complexity to septic system management.\n\nFayette County has a rich agricultural heritage, and many La Grange properties were originally farmsteads with septic systems installed decades ago. These older systems often have smaller tanks and simpler drainfield designs that require more frequent pumping to keep up with modern household water usage. Upgrading pumping frequency is often the most cost-effective way to extend the life of these aging systems.\n\nLa Grange has also attracted new residents and retirees drawn to its small-town charm, historic architecture, and proximity to both Austin and Houston. New arrivals often purchase older properties and need guidance on septic system care. Our technicians assess conditions during every pumping visit and provide maintenance recommendations specific to each property's soil and system.\n\nSeasonal flooding from the Colorado River can affect La Grange properties in low-lying areas. Keeping your tank pumped on schedule ensures maximum capacity to handle periods of high groundwater when the drainfield may be partially saturated.",

      "question": "Can flooding affect my La Grange septic system?",
