  "localRelevance": "Septic emergencies in San Marcos carry environmental weight due to the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone and the federally protected San Marcos Springs. Any uncontrolled release of septic waste has the potential to reach these sensitive resources through the fractured limestone that underlies much of the city. Emergency response in San Marcos therefore focuses on rapid containment as much as property protection. Flash flooding from Hill Country storms is a major trigger for septic emergencies in the San Marcos area. The Blanco River and San Marcos River can rise rapidly, and neighborhoods along these waterways experience periodic flooding that overwhelms septic systems. Drain field saturation, tank infiltration by floodwater, and physical damage to exposed components are common flood-related emergency scenarios. The university population in San Marcos creates seasonal demand patterns that affect septic emergencies. During high-occupancy periods, systems serving rental properties near campus experience peak loading that can push marginal systems over the edge. Back-to-school months and spring event seasons see increased emergency calls from overloaded rental property systems. Fix Septic Now maintains emergency response capability for all septic failure types throughout San Marcos and Hays County.",

      "question": "Can San Marcos river flooding cause septic emergencies?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The San Marcos and Blanco rivers can flood rapidly during Hill Country storms, overwhelming septic systems along the waterways. Floodwater saturates drain fields, enters tanks through access points, and damages mechanical components. Post-flood evaluation and emergency service are essential for affected properties."

    {
      "question": "What makes San Marcos septic emergencies environmentally sensitive?",
      "answer": "San Marcos sits above the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone and near the federally protected San Marcos Springs. Septic failures can contaminate groundwater through limestone fractures, potentially affecting the aquifer and the endangered species that depend on the springs. This environmental context makes rapid emergency response critical."
