  "localRelevance": "Routine septic maintenance is essential for Bastrop County homeowners because the area's sandy loam soil leaves little room for error when it comes to effluent quality. Unlike heavy clay soils that naturally slow and filter wastewater, sandy loam allows effluent to reach the water table relatively quickly. A well-maintained system produces higher quality effluent that the soil can safely handle, while a neglected system releases partially treated waste that can contaminate drinking water wells and the Colorado River watershed. Bastrop's climate adds another layer of importance to regular maintenance. The extreme heat of Texas summers accelerates biological activity in your tank, potentially producing excess scum that can clog outlet filters. Extended drought conditions reduce water flow through the system, allowing solids to compact and become harder to break down. Conversely, heavy spring and fall rains can hydraulically overload a system that has not been properly maintained. Seasonal maintenance visits allow our technicians to adjust your system for changing conditions. For homeowners with aerobic treatment units, which are increasingly common in Bastrop subdivisions, maintenance is not just recommended but legally required. TCEQ mandates regular inspection and servicing of ATUs to ensure they meet effluent quality standards. Our maintenance contracts satisfy these regulatory requirements and keep your system in compliance. Fix Septic Now offers flexible annual maintenance plans for all septic system types throughout Bastrop County, including the communities of Cedar Creek, Elgin, Smithville, and Red Rock.",
