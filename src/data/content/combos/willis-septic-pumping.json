  "localRelevance": "Willis is a small but steadily growing community in northern Montgomery County where septic systems are the standard rather than the exception. Without widespread municipal sewer service, virtually every home and business in the Willis area depends on a private septic system. This universal reliance makes regular pumping not just an individual maintenance task but a community necessity for protecting shared groundwater resources.\n\nThe sandy loam soil throughout the Willis area is well suited to septic drain field operation, providing natural percolation rates that support efficient effluent treatment. However, the flip side of this good drainage is that liquid leaves the tank relatively quickly, concentrating the solid waste that remains behind. Sludge and scum layers grow proportionally faster in these conditions, meaning tanks in Willis's sandy loam reach their pumping threshold sooner than they would in slower-draining clay soils.\n\nWillis's proximity to Lake Conroe adds an environmental dimension to septic maintenance. Properties near the lake and its feeder streams must be especially diligent about pumping schedules because sandy loam soil provides less natural buffering between a compromised septic system and the surrounding waterways. Regular pumping every 3 to 5 years, or more frequently for larger households, keeps solids safely contained in the tank where they belong and out of the soil and waterways that the Willis community depends on.",
