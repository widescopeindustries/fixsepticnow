  "localRelevance": "Katy's flat terrain and Beaumont clay soil create conditions where septic emergencies can develop rapidly and become severe quickly. Clay soil holds water tenaciously, and when it becomes saturated during heavy rain events, your drain field effectively shuts down. With nowhere for effluent to go, the tank fills to capacity and sewage has only one path, back toward your home. The greater Houston area's intense rainfall events can dump several inches of rain in a matter of hours, and Katy's clay-heavy ground simply cannot absorb it fast enough to keep septic systems functioning normally.\n\nFlooding is a persistent concern in western Harris County. Katy experienced devastating flooding during Hurricane Harvey and subsequent major rain events, and many septic systems sustained damage that may not have been fully addressed. Flood-compromised systems are more prone to sudden failure, especially during the next heavy rain. If your system was active during a major flood event and has not been inspected since, you may be living with a system on the edge of emergency failure.\n\nPower outages during storms create a secondary emergency trigger for Katy homes with aerobic septic systems. Without electricity, aerators stop running, pumps shut down, and effluent stops moving. During prolonged outages, which are common in Katy during severe weather, these systems can back up within 24 to 48 hours. Our emergency team can deploy portable pumping and provide temporary solutions to prevent sewage from entering your home while permanent repairs are planned.",

      "question": "What causes most septic emergencies in Katy?",
      "answer": "Heavy rainfall saturating Katy's Beaumont clay soil is the most common trigger. When clay is saturated, drain fields cannot absorb effluent and tanks overflow. Power outages affecting aerobic systems, tree root blockages, and long-deferred maintenance are other frequent causes.
