  "localRelevance": "Installing a septic system in San Marcos requires balancing site-specific soil conditions with the environmental protection requirements of the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone. Properties on limestone may require advanced treatment systems to compensate for limited soil filtration between the drain field and fractured bedrock. Clay properties need engineering that overcomes poor percolation. Many San Marcos lots sit at the geological transition between these conditions, requiring designs that address both challenges. The Edwards Aquifer rules may mandate specific system types for San Marcos properties, typically aerobic treatment units that produce higher quality effluent than conventional systems. These requirements add cost but ensure groundwater protection. Our engineers are experienced with the regulatory process and design systems that meet all environmental standards while remaining as cost-effective as possible. San Marcos' continued growth creates demand for new installations in developing areas. We work with builders and homeowners to design systems appropriate for the specific soil, slope, and environmental context of each lot. Properties intended for rental use should be designed with the higher occupancy loads typical of the university market. Fix Septic Now provides complete installation services throughout San Marcos and Hays County.",

      "question": "How much does septic installation cost in San Marcos?",
      "answer": "Installation in San Marcos ranges from $5,000 to $15,000 or more. Edwards Aquifer zone requirements often mandate aerobic systems that are more expensive than conventional designs. Rocky limestone sites add excavation costs. Clay sites may need oversized drain fields. Call (936) 292-2926 for a site evaluation and estimate."

    {
      "question": "Does the Edwards Aquifer affect what system I can install in San Marcos?",
      "answer": "Yes. Properties in the recharge zone may be required to install aerobic treatment units or other advanced systems that produce higher quality effluent than conventional septic tanks. These requirements protect the aquifer and the San Marcos Springs. We navigate the regulatory process and design compliant systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should rental property systems be designed differently in San Marcos?",
      "answer": "Yes. Rental properties near the university typically serve more occupants than a standard family home. Systems should be sized for the maximum expected occupancy, with larger tanks and appropriately scaled drain fields. Undersizing a rental property system leads to premature failure and costly replacement."
