  "localRelevance": "Cleburne's heavy blackland clay creates the most severe rain-driven septic emergencies in the DFW area. When Johnson County's dense clay saturates during spring and fall thunderstorms, drain fields shut down completely. The clay becomes a waterproof barrier that forces effluent back through the system into homes. These weather-triggered mass emergency events can affect dozens of Cleburne homes simultaneously. Drought-to-rain transitions are equally dangerous. Summer drought opens deep cracks in the clay that damage pipes and shift components. When the first heavy autumn rain arrives, the compromised systems fail catastrophically as water floods through damaged infrastructure. Homeowners may not realize the drought caused damage until the rain reveals it. Power outages during severe weather disable aerobic systems and effluent pumps throughout Cleburne, creating secondary emergencies on top of the weather-related problems. Fix Septic Now maintains emergency response capacity for the worst-case scenarios that Johnson County's extreme clay can produce.",

      "question": "Why are Cleburne septic emergencies so severe?",
      "answer": "Johnson County's heavy blackland clay becomes completely impermeable when saturated, providing absolutely no drain field absorption. This causes faster and more complete system backup than occurs in areas with lighter soil. The transition from normal operation to full emergency can happen within hours of heavy rain."
