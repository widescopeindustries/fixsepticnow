  "localRelevance": "In Cleburne's heavy blackland clay, the consequences of skipping maintenance are more severe than anywhere else in the DFW metroplex. The clay's near-zero percolation gives drain fields no reserve capacity, and once solids from an unmaintained tank begin clogging the soil, the damage is permanent. A single year of neglect in this environment can start a chain of failure that ends in complete drain field replacement costing many thousands of dollars. Seasonal maintenance is particularly important in Cleburne because the extreme clay behavior changes dramatically with the weather. Spring visits verify readiness for thunderstorm season. Summer checks detect drought damage and settling. Fall maintenance prepares the system for the wet-dry transition that causes the most component stress. Each seasonal check catches problems that only manifest under specific conditions. ATU owners in Cleburne must maintain TCEQ-compliant service contracts with quarterly visits. Our maintenance programs satisfy all regulatory requirements while providing the thorough monitoring that keeps these more complex systems performing effectively in the extreme clay environment. Fix Septic Now provides maintenance plans for all system types throughout Cleburne and Johnson County.",

      "question": "Why is maintenance more critical in Cleburne than other DFW cities?",
      "answer": "Johnson County has the heaviest blackland clay in the DFW area with near-zero percolation rates. Drain fields have absolutely no margin for error. Once clay soil becomes contaminated with solids, it seals permanently. Maintenance is the only way to prevent this irreversible and expensive failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does seasonal maintenance catch in Cleburne?",
      "answer": "Spring checks identify storm-readiness issues. Summer visits detect drought-caused component shifting and cracking. Fall maintenance catches damage from the wet-dry transition that stresses all buried structures. Each season produces different clay-related problems that only targeted seasonal inspection can detect early."
