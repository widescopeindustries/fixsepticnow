  "localRelevance": "Athens's real estate market serves buyers drawn to Cedar Creek Lake recreation, small-town living, and Henderson County's affordable land. Many transactions involve properties with septic systems that need professional evaluation before purchase.\n\nThe mixed soil profile around Athens means inspection techniques must account for both sandy loam and clay conditions. Sandy loam drainfields may hide failures because effluent drains downward invisibly. Clay drainfields may show surface stress but hide structural damage to buried components. Our inspectors test for problems in both soil environments.\n\nCedar Creek Lake properties deserve special inspection attention. We verify that systems meet setback requirements from the shoreline, assess whether seasonal water table changes affect performance, and evaluate treatment quality relative to the environmental sensitivity of the lake area.\n\nOlder Athens properties frequently lack system documentation. Our inspectors locate components, map the system layout, and provide the comprehensive information that buyers and lenders need. This is especially valuable for properties that have changed hands multiple times with little record of septic system history.",

      "question": "Should Cedar Creek Lake property buyers get septic inspections?",

An inspection reveals whether the system is adequate, compliant, and capable of protecting the lake environment. This information is critical for any lake property purchase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does an Athens inspection check in different soil types?",
      "answer": "In sandy loam areas, we focus on treatment quality and drainfield absorption testing since surface signs of failure may be absent. In clay zones, we check for soil movement damage and drainage capacity. Henderson County's mixed soil means thorough inspection must account for both conditions."
