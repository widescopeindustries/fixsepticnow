  "localRelevance": "San Marcos' active real estate market spans permanent homes, rental investments, and commercial properties, each with specific inspection needs. Pre-purchase inspections for investor-buyers considering rental properties are especially important because they evaluate whether the system can handle the higher occupancy typical of university-area rentals. A system adequate for a family of four may fail when serving six to eight tenants. The mixed geology of San Marcos requires inspectors to evaluate soil-specific risks at each property. Limestone properties need assessment for aquifer protection adequacy and root intrusion. Clay properties require evaluation of expansion damage and drain field capacity. Properties in the transition zone may have both conditions on the same lot. Experienced inspectors adapt their evaluation protocol to the specific geology encountered. Environmental compliance is a significant concern for San Marcos inspections due to the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone. Systems that were compliant when installed may not meet current standards, and some may need upgrades that affect property value and transaction costs. An inspection identifies these regulatory issues before they surprise a buyer after closing. Fix Septic Now provides thorough inspections for all property types throughout San Marcos and Hays County.",

      "question": "Should investors get inspections for San Marcos rental properties?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Rental properties face heavier use than typical homes, and a system that appears adequate may be near capacity. An inspection evaluates whether the system can handle rental occupancy levels and identifies any needed upgrades before purchase. This protects your investment from costly surprises."
