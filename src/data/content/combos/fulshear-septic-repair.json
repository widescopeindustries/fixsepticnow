  "localRelevance": "Fulshear's rapid growth creates a unique repair environment where construction-related damage co-exists with the standard soil-related wear that affects all septic systems. Heavy equipment working on adjacent lots can compact soil over drain fields, sever distribution lines, and crack tank risers. New home construction in close proximity to existing septic systems is a common scenario in Fulshear's expanding residential areas, and the vibration, grading, and soil disturbance from this activity often damages neighboring septic components.\n\nThe clay loam soil itself contributes moderate expansion-contraction forces that gradually stress pipe joints and connections. While less dramatic than the heavy clay found in Richmond, the clay content in Fulshear's soil is sufficient to cause measurable soil movement that accumulates damage over years. Combined with occasional flooding along the Brazos watershed, these conditions generate a steady stream of repair needs.\n\nFulshear's mix of new and old properties creates a diverse repair landscape. Ranch homesteads with decades-old systems need component upgrades and structural repairs, while newer homes may face warranty-related issues or problems from installations that did not fully account for site-specific conditions. Our technicians assess each situation individually and provide solutions tailored to both the immediate problem and the long-term performance expectations for your Fulshear property.",
