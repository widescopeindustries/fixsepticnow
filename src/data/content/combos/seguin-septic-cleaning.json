  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now offers thorough septic cleaning for Seguin homeowners across Guadalupe County. Our deep cleaning service removes compacted sludge, grease, and biofilm that routine pumping leaves on tank walls and baffles. Seguin's blackland clay and sandy loam soil mix means some properties need extra protection for slow-draining clay drain fields, while others must prevent untreated waste from moving too quickly through sandy soil. Either way, a thoroughly clean tank provides the best effluent quality. We use high-pressure jetting to restore tanks to peak condition. Serving all Seguin neighborhoods and the surrounding Guadalupe County area. Available 24/7. Call Fix Septic Now at (936) 292-2926.",
  "localRelevance": "Seguin's dual soil environment makes thorough septic cleaning valuable for different reasons depending on your property's location. On blackland clay lots, cleaning maximizes tank capacity so the slow-draining drain field is never overloaded. On sandy loam lots, cleaning ensures the effluent leaving your tank is as clean as possible because the sandy soil provides less natural filtration and waste can reach groundwater more quickly. Both scenarios benefit from the deeper service that cleaning provides over pumping alone. Many Seguin homes are older properties in established neighborhoods that have been pumped over the years but never truly cleaned. Decades of grease, mineral deposits from the area's moderately hard water, and compacted organic matter coat these tank interiors. Professional jetting removes layers that have accumulated since installation, often recovering significant tank volume that the homeowner did not realize was lost. The pecan processing heritage of Seguin has left some properties with unique septic challenges. Agricultural waste residues, fats from pecan processing, and other organic loads that may have entered older systems over the decades can create particularly stubborn deposits. Deep cleaning with specialized equipment addresses these heavy accumulations. Fix Septic Now provides comprehensive septic cleaning throughout Seguin and Guadalupe County.",

    {
      "question": "Why does Seguin's sandy loam soil make cleaning important?",
      "answer": "Sandy loam allows effluent to percolate to groundwater faster than clay. If your tank has reduced capacity from buildup, waste gets less treatment time before reaching the drain field. Cleaner effluent from a well-maintained tank is especially important on sandy soil where natural filtration is limited."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should Seguin tanks be deep cleaned?",
      "answer": "Every five to seven years for most Seguin homes, with regular pumping in between. Properties with older concrete tanks, heavy water usage, or garbage disposals may benefit from cleaning every four to five years. We assess conditions during service and recommend appropriate intervals for your system."
