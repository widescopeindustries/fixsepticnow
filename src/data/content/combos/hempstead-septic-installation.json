  "localRelevance": "Hempstead's sandy loam soil makes it one of the most favorable locations for septic installation in Waller County. Natural percolation rates typically fall well within the range for conventional gravity drain field systems, which are simpler, less expensive, and lower-maintenance than the aerobic or mound systems that clay-heavy areas require. This soil advantage directly translates to lower installation costs for Hempstead property owners.\n\nNew installations in the Hempstead area serve both new residential construction and replacement of aging systems. The town's growth along the US 290 corridor brings new homes that need individual septic systems, while many older ranch and farm properties have systems that have reached end of life and need modern replacements.\n\nWell protection is a key installation design consideration in Hempstead. Our engineers ensure proper setback distances between the new septic system and existing wells, positioning the drain field to minimize any risk of groundwater contamination. The direction of groundwater flow on your property influences optimal system placement, and our site evaluation accounts for these hydrogeological factors. In sandy loam, a properly positioned and installed system provides safe, reliable wastewater treatment that protects both your property and your water supply for 25 to 30 years.",
