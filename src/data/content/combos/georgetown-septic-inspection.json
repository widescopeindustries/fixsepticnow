  "localRelevance": "Septic inspections in Georgetown must account for the combined effects of two of the most challenging geological features for septic systems: expansive blackland clay and shallow limestone bedrock. Each feature produces different damage patterns and risks, and a thorough inspection evaluates both.\n\nBlackland clay damage assessment focuses on soil movement effects: cracked pipe joints, shifted distribution boxes, tank settling, and deep soil cracks that may have opened pathways for surface water or root intrusion. Our inspectors check connection points and joints that are most vulnerable to clay expansion forces, identifying damage while targeted repair is still possible.\n\nLimestone-related assessment focuses on drain field performance and groundwater protection. With limited soil depth over rock, drain field degradation has outsized consequences. Our inspectors evaluate whether the drain field is maintaining adequate absorption despite the thin soil layer and check for any signs that effluent may be reaching the limestone substrate without adequate treatment.\n\nFor Georgetown home buyers, the inspection is arguably the most important step in the purchase process for any property with a septic system. The cost of system replacement in this dual-challenge geology can exceed $20,000, making early detection of problems essential for informed decision-making.",

      "question": "What makes Georgetown inspections different from other areas?",
      "answer": "Georgetown requires dual assessment: checking for blackland clay expansion damage to buried components and evaluating limestone-specific risks including limited drain field depth and groundwater vulnerability. Most other areas deal with one soil challenge. Georgetown's combination of the two most difficult conditions demands more thorough and specialized inspection methodology."

      "question": "How often should Georgetown septic systems be inspected?",
      "answer": "Every 2 years given the aggressive blackland clay and sensitive limestone geology. Aerobic systems need annual inspections per Williamson County requirements. After significant weather events involving either drought (which cracks clay) or heavy rain (which saturates it), an inspection is advisable. Pre-purchase inspections are essential."
