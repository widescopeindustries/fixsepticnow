  "localRelevance": "Forney has experienced explosive population growth over the past decade, transforming from a small farming community into a thriving suburb east of Dallas. This rapid development has created thousands of new homes on the blackland clay prairie, many served by septic systems in areas where municipal sewer infrastructure has not yet reached.\n\nNew homeowners moving to Forney from Dallas, Mesquite, or other cities with municipal sewer service often have no experience maintaining a septic system. In blackland clay soil, learning by trial and error is an expensive proposition. The clay's inability to absorb effluent efficiently means a neglected tank will cause drainfield problems much sooner than it would in sandier regions. We educate every Forney customer about their system and recommended pumping frequency.\n\nForney's growth also means increased impervious surface area from roads, driveways, and rooftops. This directs more stormwater onto remaining undeveloped land, raising local water tables and saturating the clay soil around septic systems. Homes that had adequate drainage when first built may face new challenges as surrounding development changes water flow patterns.\n\nFix Septic Now recommends every Forney homeowner with a septic system pump their tank every two to three years. We maintain service records and send reminders so you never have to guess when your next pumping is due.",

      "question": "I just moved to Forney and have my first septic system. When should I pump?",
      "answer": "If you do not know when the previous owner last pumped, schedule a pumping visit now. We will check sludge levels and advise on timing. For a fresh start, most Forney homes need pumping every two to three years. Clay soil means sticking to this schedule is especially important."

    {
      "question": "Does Forney's growth affect my septic system?",
      "answer": "It can. Increased development around your property changes stormwater drainage patterns and may raise the local water table. This saturates the blackland clay soil around your drainfield, reducing its effectiveness. Regular pumping keeps your tank levels low so the drainfield is not overloaded during wet periods."
