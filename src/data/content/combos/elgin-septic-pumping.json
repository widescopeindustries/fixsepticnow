  "localRelevance": "Elgin occupies a transition zone in Bastrop County where sandy loam and clay soil intermingle, creating unpredictable drainage conditions. Some Elgin properties have excellent percolation in their drainfield areas, while others sit on clay-heavy ground that absorbs effluent slowly. This soil variability means there is no one-size-fits-all pumping schedule for the entire community.\n\nElgin has experienced steady growth as an Austin-area bedroom community, attracting new residents who may be unfamiliar with septic system maintenance. Highway 290 development has brought new neighborhoods and commercial properties that rely on private septic systems, increasing the demand for professional pumping services in the area.\n\nThe area's agricultural heritage means many older Elgin properties have septic systems installed decades ago when regulations and design standards were different. These aging systems often need more frequent pumping to compensate for smaller tank sizes and less efficient drainfield designs. Our technicians evaluate conditions during each pumping visit and advise Elgin homeowners on the optimal schedule for their specific system.\n\nFix Septic Now recommends Elgin properties on clay-heavy soil pump every two to three years, while those on sandier ground may extend to three to four years. We keep detailed records and send reminders so you always stay on track.",
