  "localRelevance": "Septic installation in Seguin must account for the variable soil conditions found across the community. Properties on blackland clay require oversized drain fields or alternative distribution systems because the clay's poor percolation limits absorption. Properties on sandy loam may support standard drain field designs but need careful attention to setback distances from wells and the Guadalupe River because the sandier soil provides less natural filtration. Thorough soil testing at the beginning of every project determines which approach is appropriate. The Seguin area has seen steady residential growth, with new subdivisions and individual homes being built on lots that require septic service. We coordinate with builders to integrate system design into overall lot planning, ensuring adequate space for both primary and reserve drain fields. Early involvement prevents the common problem of discovering inadequate space for the septic system after the home footprint has been finalized. Replacement installations for failed older systems represent a significant portion of Seguin installation work. Many original systems were designed using older standards and simpler technologies. Modern replacements offer improved treatment quality, better distribution methods, and designs that account for the specific soil challenges discovered through decades of experience in the area. Fix Septic Now provides complete installation services throughout Seguin and Guadalupe County.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Which Seguin soil type is easier to install in?",
      "answer": "Sandy loam is generally easier and less expensive because it offers better natural drainage and is easier to excavate. Blackland clay requires more engineering, larger drain fields, and often alternative system types. Your specific lot conditions determine the installation approach and cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Seguin installations need flood considerations?",
      "answer": "Properties in or near the Guadalupe River floodplain require elevated tank installations, flood-resistant components, and drain field placement that accounts for periodic inundation. TCEQ regulations address flood-zone installations specifically. We design systems that meet all requirements for flood-prone Seguin properties."
