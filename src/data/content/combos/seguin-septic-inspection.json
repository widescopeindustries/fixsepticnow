  "localRelevance": "Seguin's real estate market includes a diverse range of properties from historic homes to new construction, each with different septic inspection concerns. Older properties near downtown may have systems that predate current TCEQ regulations and could require upgrades. Newer homes in developing areas should be evaluated for construction quality and appropriate sizing. Properties near the Guadalupe River need special attention to flood history and its effects on system components. The mixed soil types in Seguin add complexity to inspections. On clay lots, inspectors look for pressure-related damage including tank cracks and pipe separations. On sandy loam lots, inspection focuses on erosion damage, settlement around components, and whether the faster-draining soil is receiving adequately treated effluent. Many Seguin properties contain both soil types, requiring comprehensive assessment across the entire system footprint. Flood history assessment is particularly important for Seguin properties. Prior flooding can leave lasting damage including sediment buildup in tanks, biological contamination of drain fields, and degradation of electrical and mechanical components. Even if the system appears functional today, flood damage can create weaknesses that lead to premature failure. Fix Septic Now provides detailed inspections that account for all of Seguin's unique environmental and geological factors.",

      "question": "Should flood history be part of a Seguin septic inspection?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Properties near the Guadalupe River or in known flood areas should be evaluated for flood-related damage. Prior flooding can leave sediment in tanks, damage mechanical components, and contaminate drain fields. An inspection identifies these hidden effects that may not be obvious during dry conditions."

    {
      "question": "What do inspectors check differently on Seguin's two soil types?",
      "answer": "On clay soil, inspectors focus on pressure cracks, pipe separations, and drain field saturation. On sandy loam, the focus shifts to erosion damage, settlement, and effluent quality reaching groundwater. Many Seguin lots have both soils, requiring comprehensive evaluation across the entire system. We adapt our inspection to your specific conditions."
