  "localRelevance": "Nacogdoches's real estate and rental markets both drive inspection demand. Buyers need to know what they are getting, and landlords need to verify system capacity for multi-tenant use. Our inspectors evaluate condition, capacity, and compliance for each property's specific situation.\n\nThe dual soil profile in Nacogdoches County requires inspectors who understand both sandy loam and red clay failure modes. Sandy loam drainfields may look fine from the surface while allowing inadequately treated effluent into groundwater. Red clay drainfields may show surface stress signs earlier but also experience soil movement damage to buried components. We test for both conditions.\n\nNacogdoches's historic properties sometimes have systems with no documentation. Our inspectors locate and map components, assess age and condition, and provide the complete system picture that buyers and lenders need.\n\nFor rental property investors in Nacogdoches, our inspections include capacity assessment relative to planned occupancy. A system adequate for a single family may not handle four or five college students, and knowing this before purchase prevents costly surprises.",

      "question": "Should I get a capacity assessment for a Nacogdoches rental property?",
      "answer": "Yes. A system designed for a three-bedroom family home may not handle the water usage of multiple college students. Our capacity assessment evaluates tank size, drainfield area, and soil absorption against planned occupancy to determine if the system is adequate or needs upgrading."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a Nacogdoches inspection check in red clay areas?",
      "answer": "In red clay zones, we specifically check for soil movement damage to pipes and connections, drainfield absorption capacity, signs of ponding or slow drainage, and any evidence that clay expansion has stressed structural components. These findings differ from what we look for in sandy loam areas."
