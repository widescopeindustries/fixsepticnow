  "localRelevance": "Johnson County's heavy blackland clay produces more septic repair needs per system than most DFW communities. The clay exerts tremendous lateral force on tanks and pipes when wet, pushing with enough strength to crack concrete walls and crush improperly supported pipe runs. When the soil dries, it opens cracks several feet deep that undermine components and create voids where settlement occurs. This annual cycle of destruction drives constant repair demand. Drain field failure in Cleburne's clay is among the most expensive septic repairs anywhere. The clay's extremely low percolation makes conventional field replacement difficult and expensive. Alternative approaches like soil fracturing, aeration, or mound system installation may be needed to restore wastewater treatment capability on properties where the native clay has been exhausted. Cleburne's older neighborhoods contain systems that have endured the most clay cycles and show the cumulative effects. Pipe joints that were tight at installation have separated. Concrete tanks that were sound have cracked. Distribution boxes that were level have tilted. These progressive failures eventually require professional repair. Fix Septic Now addresses all clay-related repair needs throughout Cleburne and Johnson County.",

      "question": "Is Cleburne's clay the worst in the DFW area for septic damage?",
      "answer": "Johnson County has among the heaviest and most expansive blackland clay in the DFW metroplex. The extreme forces this soil generates cause faster component deterioration than lighter clay or mixed soil areas. Systems in Cleburne typically need repair sooner and more frequently than those in sandier regions."

      "question": "What are signs of clay damage to my Cleburne septic system?",
      "answer": "Watch for settling or sinkholes around the tank, slow drains throughout the house, sewage odors, soggy yard areas over the drain field, and unusually green grass patches. After drought periods, new cracks in your yard near system components may indicate soil has shifted and damaged buried infrastructure."
