  "localRelevance": "Willis's continued residential development drives steady demand for new septic installations. As one of the primary growth corridors in northern Montgomery County along the I-45 corridor, Willis sees new home construction on formerly rural land that lacks municipal sewer connections. Each new property needs a properly designed and installed septic system engineered for the local sandy loam soil conditions.\n\nSandy loam's favorable percolation characteristics make Willis one of the more cost-effective locations for septic installation in the Houston metro area. The soil typically supports conventional gravity drain field systems, which are simpler and less expensive than the aerobic or mound systems that clay-heavy areas often require. Good soil conditions also mean smaller drain field footprints can handle equivalent household loads, preserving more of your property for other uses.\n\nReplacement installations are equally important in Willis as older systems reach end of life. Properties with systems from the 1970s through 1990s increasingly need full replacement rather than continued repair. Modern replacement systems use improved materials, better tank designs, and current engineering standards that deliver significantly better performance and longevity than the original installations they replace. Montgomery County permitting ensures all new installations meet current codes, and our team handles the entire process from application through final approval. In sandy loam, a properly installed and maintained new system can serve your Willis property reliably for 25 to 30 years.",
