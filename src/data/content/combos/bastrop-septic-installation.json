  "localRelevance": "Septic installation in Bastrop County benefits from the area's sandy loam soil, which generally provides excellent percolation rates for conventional drain field designs. However, this advantage requires careful engineering to prevent groundwater contamination from effluent that moves too quickly through the soil column without adequate treatment. Our site evaluations measure exact percolation rates, water table depth, and setback distances to ensure every installation meets or exceeds TCEQ standards for the Bastrop area. The Bastrop region has seen substantial growth, with new home construction pushing into previously undeveloped parcels. Many of these properties lack access to municipal sewer service and require new septic installations designed for the specific soil and topography of each lot. Properties near the Colorado River floodplain may require elevated or mounded systems to maintain proper separation from seasonal high water tables. Lot sizes in newer Bastrop subdivisions are sometimes smaller than traditional rural parcels, which can limit drain field options and may require alternative treatment technologies like aerobic units with spray distribution. We work with builders and homeowners to select the most cost-effective system that fits the available space while meeting all regulatory requirements. Replacement installations for failed systems are also common in Bastrop, particularly for older homes with deteriorated concrete tanks or undersized systems that no longer serve the household. Fix Septic Now handles the full scope of installation work from initial design through final inspection throughout Bastrop County.",
