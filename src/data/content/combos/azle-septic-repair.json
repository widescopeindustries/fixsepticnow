  "localRelevance": "Azle's sandy loam soil creates repair scenarios distinct from the heavy clay areas of the DFW metroplex. Sandy soil is more susceptible to erosion around system components during heavy rain, and pipe settlement can occur as loose soil shifts over time. Conversely, sandy loam is easier to excavate for repairs and typically costs less for labor-intensive work. The proximity of many Azle properties to Eagle Mountain Lake adds urgency to all repairs. A leaking tank or damaged pipe in sandy loam near the lake can contaminate the water supply quickly because the permeable soil provides a relatively fast pathway to groundwater. Any repair that involves potential sewage release near the lake receives immediate priority. Root intrusion from native oaks and other trees common in the Azle landscape is a frequent repair need. In sandy loam, tree roots spread extensively because the soil offers less resistance than clay. These roots infiltrate pipe joints, tank connections, and drain field laterals aggressively. Fix Septic Now provides all types of septic repair throughout Azle and Tarrant County.",
