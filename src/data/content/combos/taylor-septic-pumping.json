  "localRelevance": "Taylor occupies the Blackland Prairie of Williamson County where the heavy clay soil creates demanding conditions for every septic system in the community. This dense clay has among the lowest percolation rates of any soil type in Texas, meaning drain fields must work at their absolute limit to process effluent. Any excess solids that escape an overfull tank will overwhelm the drain field rapidly, creating a cascading failure that is expensive to reverse. Regular pumping is the simplest and most effective way to prevent this outcome. Taylor's established neighborhoods contain many older septic systems that have served properties for decades. These aging systems often have concrete tanks with deteriorating interiors that accumulate sludge faster, and many were designed for smaller household loads than they currently serve. If you live in an older Taylor home, pumping every two to three years is advisable rather than waiting the full three to five year interval. The recent announcement of major industrial facilities in the Taylor area has sparked significant residential development. New homes on septic systems need their first pump-out within three to five years of occupancy, and new residents moving from cities should understand the critical importance of regular maintenance in clay soil conditions. Fix Septic Now serves all of Taylor and surrounding Williamson County, providing education and service to both long-time residents and newcomers.",

    {
      "question": "Is septic pumping more urgent in Taylor's clay soil?",
      "answer": "Yes. Taylor's blackland clay drains extremely slowly, so your drain field has very limited capacity to handle solids. If solids escape an overfull tank, they clog the clay drain field permanently. Regular pumping keeps solids in the tank and protects your most expensive system component from irreversible damage."

    {
      "question": "How do I find my septic tank in Taylor?",
      "answer": "Check your property records or original building permit for a site plan showing tank location. The tank is typically 10 to 25 feet from your house in the direction of the drain field. You may notice a slight depression or raised area in the yard. Our technicians can locate your tank using probing equipment if needed."
