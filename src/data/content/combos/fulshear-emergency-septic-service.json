  "localRelevance": "Fulshear's emergencies reflect both the community's rapid development and the natural challenges of clay loam soil in the Brazos River valley. Construction activity in nearby lots is an increasingly common trigger for sudden septic emergencies, as heavy equipment accidentally severs buried distribution lines or collapses drain field sections. These construction-caused emergencies appear without warning and can release untreated sewage onto your property.\n\nWeather-driven emergencies follow the same pattern seen across Fort Bend County's clay-bearing areas. Heavy rainfall saturates the clay loam, reducing drain field absorption to a fraction of its normal capacity. If your tank is already approaching its pumping threshold, a significant rain event can cause overflow within hours. Fulshear's position in the Brazos River watershed adds flood risk from upstream events that can raise local water tables even without direct local rainfall.\n\nPower outages during storms present particular problems for Fulshear's many aerobic treatment units. These systems cannot function without electricity, and rural power restoration in western Fort Bend County can take longer than in more urban areas. Our emergency response includes temporary pumping to prevent backups during extended outages and stabilization of systems until full power and function can be restored.",
