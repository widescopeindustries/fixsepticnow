  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now installs complete septic systems for Katy properties in Harris County, from initial soil testing through final inspection. Katy's Beaumont clay soil requires careful system design to ensure long-term performance. Clay's low percolation rate means drain fields must be engineered with larger absorption areas or alternative distribution methods to handle household wastewater effectively. Our engineers design systems specifically for clay conditions, and our installation crews have extensive experience working in the dense, heavy soil common throughout western Harris County. We install conventional systems, aerobic treatment units, mound systems, and engineered alternatives. Available 24/7 for consultations and project planning. Call (936) 292-2926 to start your Katy septic installation project.",
  "localRelevance": "Installing a septic system in Katy presents engineering challenges that require clay soil expertise. Beaumont clay has percolation rates that are often at or near the limits for conventional drain field systems. Site-specific soil testing is mandatory in Harris County, and the results frequently dictate system type. Properties with particularly tight clay may require aerobic treatment units that produce cleaner effluent, mound systems that use imported fill material for better drainage, or drip irrigation systems that distribute effluent slowly across a wider area.\n\nKaty's flat topography adds another design consideration. Gravity-based systems need adequate slope to move effluent from tank to drain field, and on flat clay lots, this sometimes requires deeper excavation or pump-assisted distribution. Our engineers account for these factors during the design phase to ensure your system functions reliably from day one.\n\nThe cost of installation in Katy's clay soil tends to be higher than in sandier areas for several reasons. Excavation in heavy clay requires more powerful equipment and takes longer. Drain fields often need to be larger to compensate for slow percolation. Some sites require imported sandy fill material to create an adequate treatment zone above the native clay. However, investing in proper design and quality installation upfront saves substantial money over the life of the system by avoiding the premature drain field failures that plague undersized systems in clay soil. Harris County permit requirements ensure minimum standards, but our designs often exceed those minimums to provide extra margin for Katy's challenging conditions.",

      "question": "How much does septic installation cost in Katy?",
      "answer": "Septic installation in Katy typically costs between $7,000 and $15,000 or more. Beaumont clay soil often requires larger drain fields or alternative system types, pushing costs higher than in sandy soil areas. A conventional system may cost $7,000 to $10,000, while aerobic units or mound systems range from $10,000 to $15,000 plus. Site evaluation determines the best option."

    {
      "question": "What type of septic system works best in Katy's clay soil?",
      "answer": "Aerobic treatment units are often the best choice for Katy's Beaumont clay because they produce cleaner effluent that the slow-draining soil can handle more easily. Mound systems using imported fill above the native clay are another proven option. For properties with borderline clay, oversized conventional drain fields can work. We recommend the best system after site-specific soil testing."

    {
      "question": "How long does septic installation take in Katy?",
      "answer": "Installation in Katy typically takes 3 to 5 days of physical construction, which is slightly longer than in sandy soil areas because clay excavation is more labor-intensive. The permitting process with Harris County takes 2 to 6 weeks including soil testing, plan review, and scheduling inspections. We manage all permits and inspections for you."
