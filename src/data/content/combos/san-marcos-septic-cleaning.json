  "localRelevance": "San Marcos sits above the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, making effluent quality from septic systems an environmental priority that affects the community's water supply and the federally protected San Marcos Springs ecosystem. A tank with accumulated buildup produces lower quality effluent because waste has less volume for settling and reduced contact time with the bacterial colonies that break down organic matter. Deep cleaning restores maximum treatment capacity and directly improves the effluent that enters your drain field and eventually the soil and aquifer system. The student population in San Marcos creates unique septic challenges. Rental properties near the university often serve more residents than the original system design anticipated, generating more waste and depleting tank capacity faster. Landlords who invest in periodic deep cleaning protect their systems from the higher loads these properties experience. Between-tenant cleanings can reset the system after periods of heavy use. The moderately hard water from San Marcos area wells contributes to mineral buildup inside septic components over time. This scale reduces pipe diameters and coats tank surfaces, trapping organic matter against the walls. Professional cleaning removes both organic and mineral deposits for comprehensive tank restoration. Fix Septic Now provides deep septic cleaning for all property types throughout San Marcos and Hays County.",

    {
      "question": "Should San Marcos rental property owners invest in deep cleaning?",
      "answer": "Yes. Rental properties serving multiple tenants generate more waste than typical single-family use. Deep cleaning between tenant turnovers or every three to five years restores tank capacity that heavy use has depleted. This protects your drain field investment and prevents system failures during peak rental periods."

    {
      "question": "How does cleaning protect the Edwards Aquifer near San Marcos?",
