  "localRelevance": "Maintenance in San Marcos serves both practical and environmental purposes. Properly maintained systems produce cleaner effluent, which is critical in the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone where treated waste eventually reaches the groundwater feeding the San Marcos Springs. Every maintenance visit that keeps your system operating efficiently contributes to aquifer protection and the survival of the endangered species that depend on the springs. Rental property maintenance deserves special attention in the San Marcos market. Higher occupancy levels, tenant turnover, and varying use habits create more stress on septic systems than typical single-family use. Landlords who invest in quarterly or semi-annual maintenance for rental properties prevent the emergency failures that are disruptive, expensive, and environmentally harmful. TCEQ requires aerobic treatment unit owners to maintain active service contracts, and enforcement in the Edwards Aquifer zone around San Marcos is rigorous. Our maintenance visits satisfy all regulatory requirements while providing the thorough monitoring that keeps these systems performing at their best in the sensitive geological environment. Fix Septic Now offers flexible maintenance plans for all system types throughout San Marcos and Hays County.",
