  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now designs and installs septic systems engineered for Cleburne's extreme heavy blackland clay across Johnson County. New construction, replacements, and expansions all demand engineering that accounts for the most challenging clay conditions in the DFW metroplex. We install conventional systems with oversized drain fields, aerobic treatment units, low-pressure dosing systems, and mound designs based on site-specific soil testing. TCEQ permitting, design, installation, and inspection are managed seamlessly. Available 24/7 for consultations. Call Fix Septic Now at (936) 292-2926.",
  "localRelevance": "Installing a septic system in Cleburne's heavy blackland clay is among the most challenging installations anywhere in the DFW region. The clay's extreme expansion potential, near-zero percolation rates, and crushing force on buried structures require engineering approaches that go beyond standard practice. Systems designed without full consideration of Johnson County's clay severity fail prematurely. Percolation testing in Cleburne frequently produces results at the boundary of conventional system feasibility. Our engineers evaluate each lot to determine whether conventional oversized drain fields can work or whether alternative technologies like mound systems or aerobic treatment units are necessary. The correct decision at this stage determines decades of system performance. Backfill engineering is crucial for Cleburne installations. Native blackland clay cannot be placed directly against tanks or pipes because its expansion will damage these components. We use carefully selected fill materials in protective zones around all buried components and install flexible connections to accommodate the soil movement that no amount of engineering can entirely prevent. Fix Septic Now brings the specialized knowledge that Cleburne's extreme conditions demand for every installation throughout Johnson County.",

      "question": "How much does septic installation cost in Cleburne?",
      "answer": "Installation in Cleburne ranges from $6,000 to $15,000 or more. The extreme heavy clay typically requires larger drain fields, alternative system types, and specialized backfill that increase costs compared to lighter soils. Mound systems and aerobic units are at the higher end. Call (936) 292-2926 for a site estimate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What system type works best in Cleburne's heavy clay?",
      "answer": "Mound systems and low-pressure dosing designs often perform best because they distribute effluent evenly and can be built above the heaviest clay layers. Aerobic units producing higher-quality effluent help compensate for the clay's near-zero drainage. Soil testing determines the optimal system for your specific Cleburne lot."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Cleburne installations cost more than other areas?",
      "answer": "Johnson County's heavy clay requires larger drain fields, specialized backfill materials, flexible connections, and often alternative system technologies that are more expensive than conventional installations in better-draining soil. The additional engineering ensures long-term performance in the most demanding conditions."
