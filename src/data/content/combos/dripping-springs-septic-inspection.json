  "localRelevance": "Septic inspections in Dripping Springs serve a broader purpose than in most communities. Beyond evaluating system function for the property owner, inspections help ensure that individual systems are not contributing to aquifer contamination, which is a community-wide concern in this environmentally sensitive Hill Country setting.\n\nFor Dripping Springs home buyers, inspections are arguably more critical than anywhere else in our service area. The cost of drain field replacement on limestone can be two to three times what it costs in deep soil areas because alternative engineered systems are usually required. Discovering a failing drain field during a pre-purchase inspection can save a buyer tens of thousands of dollars and provide critical negotiating information.\n\nHays County's growing attention to water quality means that septic system condition is increasingly relevant to both property values and regulatory compliance. Properties near Edwards Aquifer recharge zones face additional scrutiny, and a clean inspection report demonstrates responsible stewardship. For existing Dripping Springs homeowners, inspections every 2 years provide the regular monitoring that this sensitive environment demands, catching problems when corrective action is still straightforward rather than waiting for failures that carry environmental consequences.",
