  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides essential septic maintenance plans for Georgetown homeowners in Williamson County, available 24/7. Georgetown's blackland clay and limestone geology creates the most maintenance-critical conditions in our entire service area. Expansive clay damages components through relentless movement cycles, slow drainage gives your system zero margin for error, and shallow limestone means any failure directly threatens groundwater. Our plans include aggressive pumping schedules, semi-annual inspections for clay damage, quarterly aerobic servicing, mineral scale monitoring, and effluent quality checks. Call (936) 292-2926 to start your Georgetown maintenance plan.",
  "localRelevance": "Georgetown combines the maintenance demands of heavy clay with the environmental sensitivity of limestone geology, creating conditions where proactive professional care is truly essential. The blackland clay's expansion and contraction cycles produce ongoing physical damage to buried components that must be monitored regularly. The extremely slow drainage gives your system almost no buffer capacity, meaning even minor lapses in maintenance can have immediate consequences. And the shallow limestone beneath means that any system malfunction has a direct pathway to the groundwater.\n\nMost Georgetown septic systems are aerobic units with spray or drip distribution, which are mechanically complex systems requiring quarterly professional attention. Aerators, pumps, chlorinators, distribution components, and electronic controls all need regular inspection and servicing. In Georgetown's hard water from the limestone aquifer, mineral scale builds rapidly on all these components and must be monitored and addressed to prevent function degradation.\n\nWilliamson County requires maintenance contracts for aerobic systems. Fix Septic Now provides comprehensive maintenance for Georgetown properties that goes beyond minimum requirements to include clay damage monitoring, mineral scale tracking, and effluent quality verification. Our semi-annual comprehensive inspections catch clay movement damage, drain field degradation, and component wear early enough for affordable corrective action. The $300 to $400 annual maintenance investment protects a system worth $10,000 to $20,000 and shields the aquifer resources that the entire Georgetown community depends on.",

    {
      "question": "Why is Georgetown the most maintenance-critical area you serve?",
      "answer": "Georgetown combines three challenges simultaneously: expansive blackland clay that damages components through movement, extremely slow drainage that eliminates system margin, and shallow limestone that connects any failure directly to groundwater. No other area in our service region faces all three of these challenges at once. Consistent maintenance is the only way to manage this combination."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Georgetown maintenance include beyond standard plans?",
      "answer": "Beyond standard aerobic servicing, our Georgetown plans add semi-annual clay damage inspections checking for soil movement effects on pipes and connections, mineral scale monitoring due to the extremely hard limestone water, drain field performance tracking given the limited soil depth, and effluent quality verification to ensure treatment meets the standards this sensitive environment requires."
