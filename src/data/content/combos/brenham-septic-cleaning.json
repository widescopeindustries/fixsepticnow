  "localRelevance": "Brenham's mix of residential, agricultural, and tourism-driven commercial properties creates diverse septic cleaning needs. Restaurants and food establishments that are part of Brenham's vibrant visitor economy generate high-grease wastewater that coats tank interiors faster than residential use. Regular professional cleaning keeps these commercial systems operating efficiently.\n\nWashington County's sandy loam and clay soil means tank performance directly impacts both drainfield longevity and groundwater protection. A dirty tank with reduced capacity sends partially treated effluent through the system faster, providing less biological treatment time. In sandy loam areas, this means lower-quality effluent reaches permeable soil that can transmit contaminants to the water table. In clay areas, the reduced capacity pushes the drainfield harder.\n\nOlder Brenham properties often have concrete tanks with decades of accumulated buildup. These deposits reduce effective volume and accelerate concrete corrosion from hydrogen sulfide gas produced by decomposing waste. Professional cleaning removes the source material, slowing corrosion and reclaiming lost capacity.\n\nWe recommend Brenham homeowners schedule cleaning every three to five years. Commercial properties, especially those in the food service industry, may need annual or semi-annual cleaning to manage grease accumulation effectively.",

      "question": "Why do Brenham restaurants need septic cleaning?",
      "answer": "Restaurants generate large amounts of grease that accumulates inside septic tanks beyond what pumping alone can remove. Grease coats walls and baffles, reducing capacity and treatment efficiency. Regular professional cleaning prevents grease from reaching the drainfield where it causes permanent clogging."
