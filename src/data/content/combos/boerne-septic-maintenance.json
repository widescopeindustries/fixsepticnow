  "localRelevance": "Maintenance for Boerne septic systems carries both legal and environmental obligations that make it essential rather than optional. TCEQ requires all aerobic treatment unit owners to maintain active service contracts, and most Boerne properties use ATUs due to the karst terrain's environmental sensitivity. Lapses in maintenance can result in regulatory penalties and, more importantly, can allow untreated waste to reach the aquifer through fractured limestone. The hard water common throughout Kendall County creates unique maintenance challenges. Calcium and mineral deposits accumulate on spray heads, inside distribution pipes, and on filter screens, gradually reducing system efficiency. Regular maintenance visits include checking for and addressing mineral buildup before it restricts flow or degrades distribution patterns. Boerne's native vegetation, including Ashe juniper and live oaks, requires ongoing root management as part of septic maintenance. Each visit includes inspection of accessible components for root intrusion signs, and we recommend camera inspection of pipe runs on a periodic basis to detect root entry before it causes blockages or structural damage. The seasonal patterns of the Hill Country, from hot dry summers to sporadic heavy rains, affect system performance throughout the year. Our maintenance schedule accounts for these conditions, checking chlorine consumption rates during summer heat, verifying drainage performance before wet seasons, and ensuring mechanical components are ready for year-round demands. Fix Septic Now provides TCEQ-compliant maintenance for all system types throughout Boerne and Kendall County.",
