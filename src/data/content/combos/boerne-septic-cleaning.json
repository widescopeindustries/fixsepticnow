  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides deep septic cleaning for Boerne homeowners committed to protecting Kendall County's karst limestone environment. Cleaning goes beyond pumping to remove hardened sludge, mineral scale, grease deposits, and biofilm that coat tank interiors and reduce capacity. In Boerne's sensitive karst terrain, a thoroughly clean tank with maximum volume and treatment efficiency is essential for producing the high-quality effluent that protects groundwater. Our crews use high-pressure jetting and descaling equipment suited to the mineral-rich conditions of the Hill Country. Serving all Boerne neighborhoods and surrounding ranch properties. Available 24/7. Call Fix Septic Now at (936) 292-2926.",
  "localRelevance": "Boerne's location on the Edwards Plateau means the extremely hard water common to the area deposits heavy mineral scale inside septic tanks. Over years, this calcium carbonate coating builds up on tank walls, baffles, and pipe openings, reducing effective volume and trapping organic matter. Standard pumping removes the liquid contents but leaves this mineral layer intact. Professional cleaning with descaling capability removes these deposits and restores the tank to full operational capacity. In karst terrain where effluent quality directly affects aquifer safety, every measure that improves treatment is worthwhile. Boerne's upscale residential developments often feature custom homes with larger-than-average septic systems to accommodate spacious floor plans with multiple bathrooms. These larger systems still require periodic deep cleaning because the same grease and sludge accumulation processes occur regardless of tank size. In fact, the perception that a larger tank does not need attention can lead to extended intervals between service, allowing significant buildup to develop. Many Kendall County properties are on multi-acre tracts with systems that may be located far from the home. Tree canopy, rocky terrain, and seasonal creek crossings can make access challenging. Our crews have the equipment and experience to reach and service tanks in any location across the Boerne Hill Country. Fix Septic Now delivers thorough septic cleaning throughout Boerne and Kendall County.",

    {
      "question": "Why does Boerne's hard water require special septic cleaning?",
      "answer": "Boerne's well water is extremely hard from its passage through limestone. This deposits calcium scale inside your septic tank that standard pumping cannot remove. Over years, this buildup reduces tank capacity by up to 20 percent. Cleaning with descaling equipment removes these mineral deposits and restores full system performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should Boerne tanks be deep cleaned?",
      "answer": "Every five to seven years is recommended for most Boerne homes, with routine pumping every two to four years in between. Properties with particularly hard water or older tanks with rough concrete surfaces may benefit from more frequent cleaning. Environmental sensitivity of the karst terrain justifies proactive care."
