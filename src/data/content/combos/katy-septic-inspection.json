  "localRelevance": "Septic inspections in the Katy area require specialized knowledge of how Beaumont clay soil affects system performance. Clay's low permeability means drain fields operate under tighter margins than in sandier regions, and the seasonal expansion and contraction of the soil creates physical stresses on components that are not visible from the surface. A qualified inspector knows where to look for clay-specific damage and how to interpret signs that might seem normal in other soil types.\n\nFor Katy home buyers, a septic inspection is particularly important because of the high cost of drain field replacement in clay soil. A failing drain field that might cost $3,000 to replace in sandy loam could easily cost double in Beaumont clay due to the larger field area required and the more complex engineering involved. Discovering this during an inspection rather than after purchase can save you thousands and give you negotiating leverage.\n\nMany Katy properties were developed during the area's rapid growth phases, and not all original installations were designed with adequate margins for clay soil conditions. Some systems were undersized based on overly optimistic soil tests. Our inspectors evaluate whether your system's capacity matches both your household usage and the actual soil conditions on your property. We also assess flood vulnerability, which is a critical factor in western Harris County where many properties have experienced high water events. A comprehensive inspection report helps you plan ahead rather than react to emergencies.",
