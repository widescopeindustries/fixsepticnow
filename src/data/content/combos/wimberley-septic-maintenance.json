  "localRelevance": "Septic maintenance in Wimberley carries legal and environmental weight that goes beyond standard homeowner responsibilities. TCEQ requires all aerobic treatment unit owners to maintain active maintenance contracts with licensed service providers, and in the Edwards Aquifer contributing zone around Wimberley, enforcement of this requirement is particularly rigorous. Failing to maintain a current contract can result in regulatory action and fines, in addition to the environmental risk of operating an unmonitored system above fractured limestone. The karst environment of Wimberley makes proactive maintenance essential because the consequences of system failure are immediate and severe. Unlike areas with deep soil that can temporarily absorb poorly treated effluent, Wimberley's thin soil over fractured limestone offers virtually no buffer. A malfunctioning aerobic blower, clogged spray head, or depleted chlorine supply can result in untreated waste reaching bedrock fractures within days. Regular maintenance visits catch these issues before they become environmental incidents. Seasonal conditions in the Wimberley Valley affect maintenance priorities throughout the year. Summer heat can accelerate chlorine consumption in disinfection chambers, requiring more frequent tablet replacement. Fall leaf drop can clog spray heads and surface distribution components. Winter cold, while mild by national standards, can occasionally affect exposed components. Spring rains test drain field and spray field capacity. Our maintenance schedule accounts for all seasonal factors specific to the Wimberley area. Fix Septic Now offers TCEQ-compliant maintenance contracts for all aerobic and conventional septic systems in Wimberley and throughout Hays County.",

      "question": "Is septic maintenance legally required in Wimberley?",
      "answer": "Yes, if you have an aerobic treatment unit, which most Wimberley properties require. TCEQ mandates that ATU owners maintain an active service contract with a licensed maintenance provider. Failure to maintain this contract can result in regulatory penalties. Even conventional systems in the Edwards Aquifer zone benefit from regular professional maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I skip maintenance on my Wimberley septic system?",
      "answer": "Skipping maintenance in Wimberley risks both regulatory penalties and environmental damage. Without regular service, aerobic systems can discharge untreated effluent into karst limestone where it reaches groundwater rapidly. You may also lose your TCEQ maintenance compliance status, which can complicate property sales and result in fines."
