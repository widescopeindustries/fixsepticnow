  "localRelevance": "Pre-purchase inspections in Cleburne are particularly important because Johnson County's extreme blackland clay inflicts progressive damage that may not be visible on the surface. A tank can be cracked, pipes partially separated, and the drain field approaching failure while the yard looks perfectly normal. Only professional inspection with appropriate tools reveals these hidden problems that the dense clay conceals. Cleburne's housing stock ranges from historic homes near downtown to modern subdivisions. Older properties need assessment of remaining useful life after decades of clay-force exposure. Newer systems should be evaluated for proper construction quality, adequate sizing, and appropriate design for the severe clay conditions. Not all systems in Cleburne were designed with the extreme soil conditions fully accounted for. Fix Septic Now provides detailed inspections adapted to each Cleburne property's age, system type, and specific location within Johnson County's heavy clay landscape.",

    {
      "question": "Why is inspection critical before buying in Cleburne?",
      "answer": "Johnson County's heavy clay causes progressive hidden damage to septic systems. A property that looks fine above ground may have a cracked tank, separated pipes, and a failing drain field below. Repairs in heavy clay are expensive. An inspection protects you from inheriting these costly problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What clay-specific damage do Cleburne inspectors find?",
