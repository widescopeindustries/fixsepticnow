  "localRelevance": "Forney's real estate market is among the most active in the greater Dallas area, and septic inspections are a critical component of property transactions involving private systems. Buyers relocating from municipal sewer areas need professional guidance to understand the system they are purchasing, and sellers benefit from addressing issues before listing.\n\nIn Kaufman County's blackland clay soil, inspections reveal problems that surface observations cannot detect. A drainfield may appear normal from above while effluent is ponding in the gravel trenches just inches below the clay surface. Settling around newer installations may have shifted pipe connections without any visible sign at grade level. Our inspectors use hydraulic load testing, camera technology, and systematic evaluation to uncover these hidden conditions.\n\nForney's mix of newer and established neighborhoods means inspection findings vary widely. Newer homes may have systems with construction-related settling issues, while older properties may have undersized or aging systems nearing end of life. In both cases, an inspection provides the data needed to make informed decisions about maintenance, repair, or replacement.\n\nWe also offer pre-construction inspections for Forney buyers purchasing lots where an existing septic system will serve a new home. These evaluations confirm the system's capacity matches the planned home's bedroom count and water usage projections.",
