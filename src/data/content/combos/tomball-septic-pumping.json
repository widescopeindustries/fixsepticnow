  "localRelevance": "Tomball sits in northwest Harris County where sandy loam soil prevails, creating favorable conditions for septic systems but also specific maintenance demands. The good percolation rate of sandy loam means your drain field efficiently absorbs liquid effluent, but the flip side is that solids concentrate more quickly in the tank as the liquid fraction exits faster. Without regular pumping, these concentrated solids can overflow the tank's baffles and migrate into your drain field, where they clog the soil pores that your system depends on.\n\nThe Tomball area has maintained its semi-rural character in many neighborhoods even as growth has pushed outward from Houston. Properties along Spring Creek, Willow Creek, and the surrounding countryside rely heavily on septic systems. Many of these properties have larger lots with mature trees, which creates additional demands on septic maintenance due to root activity near system components.\n\nTomball's position at a slightly higher elevation than much of the surrounding Harris County flat lands means groundwater levels are generally favorable for septic operation. However, the area still receives the same intense rainfall common to Southeast Texas, and even sandy loam soil can become temporarily saturated during major rain events. A tank that is overdue for pumping during one of these events has a much higher risk of backing up. Keeping your Tomball septic tank pumped every 3 to 5 years, or more frequently for larger households, provides the buffer your system needs to handle wet weather without problems.",

Families of five or more, or homes using garbage disposals, should pump every 2 to 3 years.
