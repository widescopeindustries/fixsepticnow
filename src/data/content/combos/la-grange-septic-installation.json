  "localRelevance": "La Grange and Fayette County offer a mix of soil conditions that make every septic installation unique. Properties in the Colorado River bottomland may have sandy alluvial soil with good drainage but seasonal water table concerns. Higher ground around town often features a mix of sandy loam and clay that requires careful testing to determine drainfield suitability.\n\nNew construction in the La Grange area includes both primary residences and weekend or retirement homes. Properties intended for part-time use have different design considerations than full-time residences, and we account for usage patterns in system sizing and technology selection.\n\nFayette County permitting requires site evaluation, soil analysis, and system design approval before construction can begin. Fix Septic Now manages this entire process, from the initial property visit through final county inspection and system activation. Our familiarity with Fayette County's specific requirements helps avoid delays.\n\nFlood zone considerations affect some La Grange installations. Properties in or near the Colorado River floodplain may need elevated components, flood-resistant tank connections, and drainfield designs that account for periodic high water. We design systems that perform during normal conditions while withstanding the occasional flooding that affects this area.",
