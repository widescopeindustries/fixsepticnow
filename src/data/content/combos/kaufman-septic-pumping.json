  "localRelevance": "As the county seat of Kaufman County, the city of Kaufman sits in an area where municipal sewer service covers the town center but many surrounding properties rely on private septic systems. The blackland clay soil that dominates Kaufman County is one of the most challenging environments for septic operation in Texas, requiring homeowners to be diligent about pumping schedules.\n\nBlackland clay has an extremely low percolation rate, meaning effluent leaving your tank enters the drainfield and absorbs into the ground very slowly. This creates a bottleneck effect where your tank remains fuller than it would in sandier soil, leaving less room for incoming wastewater from your home. Regular pumping removes accumulated solids that take up valuable tank space and ensures effluent flows properly to the drainfield.\n\nKaufman's proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex has driven residential growth on previously agricultural land. Many of these new developments use septic systems, and homeowners moving from city-served properties may be unfamiliar with the pumping requirements. In Kaufman County's clay, waiting until you notice slow drains or odors means you have already waited too long.\n\nFix Septic Now recommends Kaufman homeowners pump every two to three years and keeps records so you always know when your next service is due. We also check for early warning signs during every pumping visit at no extra charge.",

      "question": "Why does clay soil in Kaufman affect my pumping schedule?",
      "answer": "Kaufman County's blackland clay absorbs effluent very slowly, so your tank stays fuller longer than it would in sandy soil. This means solids accumulate faster relative to available space. More frequent pumping prevents the tank from reaching capacity and sending solids into the drainfield, where they cause costly damage."
