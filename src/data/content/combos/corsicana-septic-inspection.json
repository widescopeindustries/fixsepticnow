  "localRelevance": "Septic inspections are critically important for Corsicana properties because of the unique challenges presented by Navarro County's blackland clay soil. This soil type masks problems that would be visible in sandier terrain. A failing drainfield in clay soil may not show obvious surface signs until the damage is extensive, making professional inspection the only reliable way to catch issues early.\n\nThe Corsicana real estate market sees steady activity, and most mortgage lenders require a septic inspection before approving a loan on a property with a private system. Our inspectors are familiar with the requirements of major lenders and title companies operating in Navarro County, ensuring your inspection report meets all necessary standards for closing.\n\nBeyond real estate transactions, routine inspections help Corsicana homeowners plan maintenance proactively. An inspection reveals the current sludge level in your tank, the condition of baffles and structural components, and the performance of your drainfield. In blackland clay, we pay special attention to signs of soil glazing around drainfield trenches, which indicates reduced absorption capacity. We also check for evidence of shifting soil damaging pipe connections and tank integrity.\n\nFix Septic Now recommends Corsicana homeowners schedule an inspection every two to three years between pumping appointments to stay ahead of potential problems.",
