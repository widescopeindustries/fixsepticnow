  "localRelevance": "Maintenance in Weatherford should be adapted to your property's soil type. Sandy loam properties need maintenance focused on effluent quality to protect groundwater, since faster drainage means less natural filtration. Clay-influenced properties need attention to drain field capacity and soil-pressure damage to components. Our technicians assess both factors during every maintenance visit. Parker County's rural ranches benefit particularly from regular maintenance because their septic systems may be distant from the home and problems can go unnoticed until they become serious. Scheduled maintenance visits ensure these remote systems receive professional attention on a consistent basis. ATU owners in Weatherford must maintain TCEQ-compliant service contracts. Our quarterly visits satisfy all requirements. Fix Septic Now serves all Weatherford and Parker County properties with flexible maintenance plans.",
