  "localRelevance": "The Woodlands is a master-planned community that was developed with careful attention to its natural forested setting in southern Montgomery County. While most of the community connects to municipal utilities, numerous properties on the outskirts and in older sections of The Woodlands still rely on individual septic systems. These systems operate in sandy loam soil that provides good natural drainage but must contend with the extensive root networks of the mature hardwoods and pines that give The Woodlands its signature character.\n\nThe dense tree canopy throughout The Woodlands means root intrusion is a persistent concern for septic system owners. Trees actively seek the moisture and nutrients surrounding septic components, and in sandy loam soil, roots encounter relatively little resistance as they grow toward these sources. While root intrusion is primarily a repair issue, regular pumping helps reduce the attraction by keeping waste levels managed and minimizing the nutrient gradient that draws roots toward your system.\n\nThe Woodlands also experiences the same intense rainfall events that affect the greater Houston area. Spring Creek and its network of tributaries wind throughout the community, and properties near these waterways face higher groundwater levels during wet seasons. Even sandy loam becomes temporarily saturated during major rain events, and a tank that is near capacity during these periods risks backing up. Pumping every 3 to 4 years for standard households maintains sufficient buffer capacity to handle wet weather without system stress.",
