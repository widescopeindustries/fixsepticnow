  "localRelevance": "Elgin's expanding population along the Highway 290 corridor makes reliable septic maintenance increasingly important. More homes on septic systems means greater collective impact on Bastrop County's groundwater if systems are not properly maintained. Individual maintenance protects both your property and the broader community.\n\nOur Elgin maintenance plans address the dual challenges of mixed soil conditions. For properties on sandy loam, we focus on ensuring the tank provides thorough primary treatment before effluent reaches the permeable drainfield soil. For clay-heavy properties, we monitor drainfield absorption and tank levels closely to prevent hydraulic overload. Many Elgin properties have both soil types present, and our technicians adjust their evaluation accordingly.\n\nNew Elgin residents coming from urban areas often underestimate the importance of septic maintenance because they have never had to think about wastewater before. Our plans include educational support during initial visits so homeowners understand what their system needs and why each maintenance step matters.\n\nAerobic treatment systems in Elgin require quarterly maintenance inspections per Texas law. Fix Septic Now is certified to provide this service and handles all required documentation. Our maintenance visits for aerobic systems include checking mechanical components, verifying treatment quality, and ensuring spray distribution or drip systems are functioning correctly.",
