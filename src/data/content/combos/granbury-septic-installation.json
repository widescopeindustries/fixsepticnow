  "localRelevance": "Granbury's sandy loam soil offers favorable installation conditions for many properties, supporting conventional drain fields at reasonable cost. However, shallow limestone bedrock on some Hood County lots can limit excavation depth and require engineered solutions. Properties near Lake Granbury may face additional requirements for enhanced treatment to protect the water supply and recreation resource. The mix of full-time homes and seasonal lake properties creates different installation design requirements. Year-round residences need systems sized for daily use, while seasonal properties may need designs that handle intermittent heavy loading and extended idle periods. We engineer for the actual use pattern each property will experience. Fix Septic Now provides complete installation services throughout Granbury and Hood County.",

      "question": "Do Granbury lake properties need special septic systems?",
      "answer": "Properties close to Lake Granbury may require aerobic treatment units or enhanced systems to meet water quality protection standards. The sandy loam's rapid drainage means higher treatment quality is needed to compensate for less natural soil filtration before effluent reaches groundwater and the lake."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does limestone affect Granbury septic installations?",
      "answer": "Some Hood County properties have limestone near the surface that limits excavation depth. Tank placement may require rock cutting, and drain fields may need engineered fill above the bedrock. These conditions add cost but are manageable with the right equipment and design expertise."
