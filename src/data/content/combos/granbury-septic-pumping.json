  "localRelevance": "Granbury's appeal as a lakeside community means many homes sit in proximity to Lake Granbury and the Brazos River, making septic maintenance directly relevant to water quality. The sandy loam and limestone soil in Hood County provides moderate filtration, but regular pumping is still essential to prevent solids from reaching these waterways through groundwater or surface drainage. The mix of full-time residences and weekend lake homes in Granbury creates varied septic use patterns. Seasonal properties may sit idle for weeks then experience heavy use during weekends and holidays. These usage fluctuations can stress septic systems differently than steady daily use, and pumping schedules should account for total annual loading rather than just occupancy frequency. Granbury's historic downtown and surrounding older neighborhoods contain aging septic systems that have served for decades. These older systems often need more frequent pumping to compensate for reduced tank integrity and smaller capacity relative to current household demands. Fix Septic Now serves all of Granbury and Hood County with reliable pumping on flexible schedules.",

      "question": "How does my septic system affect Lake Granbury?",
      "answer": "Septic effluent travels through the soil to groundwater, which eventually feeds the lake and Brazos River system. Sandy loam provides moderate filtration, but excess solids from an overfull tank can contaminate these water resources. Regular pumping keeps solids contained and protects the lake water quality."

    {
      "question": "How often should Granbury lake homes be pumped?",
      "answer": "Full-time residences should pump every three to five years. Weekend and seasonal lake homes should pump every three to four years despite lower total use, because intermittent occupancy can stress bacterial populations and cause uneven sludge accumulation. Proximity to the lake also warrants more conservative scheduling."
