  "localRelevance": "The New Braunfels real estate market attracts buyers from across Texas seeking Hill Country living, and many available properties rely on septic systems. Pre-purchase inspections are essential because the mixed limestone and clay geology creates varied failure modes that differ from property to property. A system on shallow limestone requires different evaluation criteria than one on deep clay, and many New Braunfels lots feature both conditions. Experienced inspectors adjust their assessment based on the specific geology of each property. Vacation rental properties represent a growing segment of the New Braunfels real estate market. Systems on these properties may have experienced irregular maintenance and heavy peak loads from tourist occupancy. An inspection for a potential rental investment evaluates not just current condition but whether the system can handle the demands of short-term rental use. This assessment can prevent costly surprises after purchase. New Braunfels' proximity to the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone and sensitive waterways means some properties are subject to stricter environmental regulations regarding septic system performance. An inspection identifies whether a system meets these requirements and flags any compliance issues that might affect a property transfer. Fix Septic Now provides thorough inspections for all system types across New Braunfels and Comal County.",
