  "localRelevance": "Seguin's mixed soil environment produces diverse septic repair needs. Properties on blackland clay experience the familiar pattern of expansion and contraction damage, with cracked tanks, separated pipe joints, and distribution box shifting caused by seasonal soil movement. Properties on sandy loam face different challenges, including erosion around system components during heavy rain, pipe settlement as sandy soil shifts, and drain field washout during flood events along the Guadalupe River corridor. The age diversity of Seguin's housing stock creates a range of repair scenarios. Historic homes near downtown may have concrete or even steel tanks that have reached end of life and need complete replacement. Mid-century homes along the growth corridors may have systems that were adequate when built but are now undersized for modern household demands. Newer developments may present construction-quality issues. Each requires a different repair approach. Flooding along the Guadalupe River periodically affects Seguin properties near the waterway. Floodwater can damage septic components through physical force, sediment infiltration, and saturation of the drain field. Post-flood repairs may include cleaning sediment from tanks, replacing waterlogged mechanical components, and rehabilitating drain fields that were submerged. Fix Septic Now handles all repair types for Seguin and Guadalupe County properties.",
