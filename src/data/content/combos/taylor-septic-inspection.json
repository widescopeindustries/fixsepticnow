  "localRelevance": "Taylor's renewed growth as a major employment center has energized the local real estate market, bringing many buyers to properties served by septic systems. Pre-purchase inspections are essential in Taylor because the blackland clay soil creates hidden damage patterns that may not produce visible symptoms until the problem is severe. A cracked tank can leak for months in dense clay without creating surface evidence, and a struggling drain field may appear dry during a drought-period showing but fail completely when wet weather returns. The Taylor market includes older homes near downtown with decades-old septic systems as well as brand-new construction in developing areas. Older systems require assessment of remaining useful life, structural condition after years of clay pressure, and compliance with current TCEQ standards. New systems should be evaluated for construction quality and proper sizing relative to the intended occupancy. Both scenarios benefit from professional inspection before purchase. Taylor's agricultural history means some properties on the outskirts of town have septic systems that served farmsteads with lighter usage than a modern residential household will generate. An inspection identifies whether these systems have adequate capacity for contemporary family use or will need upgrades. Fix Septic Now provides thorough inspections for all system types throughout Taylor and Williamson County.",
