  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides dependable septic pumping services to Katy homeowners in Harris County, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Katy's Beaumont clay soil creates specific challenges for septic systems that make regular pumping essential. Clay soil drains slowly, which means your septic tank and drain field work harder to process wastewater. When tanks are not pumped on schedule, the slow drainage compounds the problem and can lead to backups, soggy yards, and drain field saturation. Our pump trucks serve properties throughout the Katy area, from the older neighborhoods near downtown Katy to the newer master-planned communities extending into western Harris County. We handle residential tanks of all sizes and commercial systems as well. Call Fix Septic Now at (936) 292-2926 for reliable septic pumping in Katy, TX.",
  "localRelevance": "Katy sits in the western reaches of Harris County where Beaumont clay soil dominates the landscape. This heavy clay creates a fundamentally different septic environment compared to sandier areas further north. Clay soil has very low permeability, meaning water moves through it slowly. For septic systems, this translates to drain fields that absorb effluent at a reduced rate, keeping tanks fuller for longer periods and demanding more frequent pump-outs to avoid overloading.\n\nThe Katy area has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades, with large master-planned communities like Cinco Ranch, Cross Creek Ranch, and Cane Island expanding into formerly agricultural land. While many of these developments connect to municipal sewer, numerous properties on the outskirts and in unincorporated Harris County still rely on septic systems. These systems must contend with Beaumont clay that swells when wet and shrinks when dry, creating movement in the soil that can stress tank and pipe connections.\n\nKaty's flat terrain and clay soil also make the area prone to slow drainage after heavy rains. When the ground is saturated, which happens frequently during Houston's rainy season, your septic drain field essentially stops working. A full tank during a saturated soil event is a recipe for sewage backup. Keeping your tank pumped on a regular schedule of every 2 to 3 years in Katy's clay conditions gives your system the buffer it needs to handle these high-water periods without backing up into your home.",

      "question": "How often should I pump my septic tank in Katy's clay soil?",
      "answer": "In Katy's Beaumont clay soil, we recommend pumping every 2 to 3 years rather than the standard 3 to 5 year interval. Clay soil drains slowly, so your tank stays fuller and solids accumulate to critical levels faster. Homes with garbage disposals or larger families should consider pumping every 2 years to stay ahead of buildup."

    {
      "question": "Why does clay soil in Katy affect my septic pumping schedule?",
      "answer": "Beaumont clay has very low permeability, meaning effluent leaves your tank slowly. This keeps the liquid level higher and gives solids less room to settle properly. Over time, solids can be pushed into the drain field where they clog soil pores that are already tight from the clay. More frequent pumping prevents this chain of problems."
