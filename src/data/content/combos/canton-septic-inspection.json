  "localRelevance": "Canton's active real estate market, fueled in part by the area's appeal as a destination community near First Monday Trade Days, makes septic inspections a frequent necessity. Buyers unfamiliar with rural property ownership need reliable information about the septic system before committing to a purchase, and sellers benefit from addressing issues proactively.\n\nVan Zandt County's soil variability adds complexity to inspections. A single property may have sandy loam in one area and heavy clay in another, creating uneven drainfield performance that only a professional evaluation can detect. We test drainfield absorption by observing how the system handles a hydraulic load and checking for signs of ponding, breakout, or saturated soil above the trenches.\n\nOlder Canton properties often have septic systems with limited or missing documentation. Our inspectors locate tanks and drainfields using probes and electronic locators, then assess the system's design and condition. We frequently encounter unpermitted additions or modifications to older systems that may not meet current standards. Our inspection reports clearly note these findings so you can make informed decisions.\n\nFor Canton homeowners who are not buying or selling, routine inspections every two to three years help track system performance and catch developing problems early. This is especially important in Van Zandt County where soil shifts between wet and dry seasons can gradually damage underground components.",
