  "localRelevance": "Waller sits in Waller County where the soil transitions between the sandy loam found to the north and the heavier clay common to the south and east. This mixed sandy loam and clay soil means septic system performance varies considerably from one property to the next. A home on the sandier side of town may see efficient drainage and slower tank accumulation, while a property a mile away on clay-dominant soil operates with tighter margins and faster sludge buildup.\n\nThis variability makes it important for Waller homeowners to establish a pumping schedule based on their specific conditions rather than relying on general guidelines. Our technicians measure sludge and scum levels during service visits to determine how quickly your tank accumulates waste, then recommend a pumping interval tailored to your property. For properties on sandier soil, every 3 to 5 years may be appropriate. For those on the clay side, every 2 to 3 years is often necessary.\n\nWaller's agricultural heritage means many properties include barns, workshops, and secondary structures that may contribute additional wastewater to the septic system. Homes with higher water usage from these activities fill their tanks faster and need more frequent pumping. The community's rural character also means most properties use private wells, connecting septic system health directly to drinking water safety. Regular pumping is the first line of defense in protecting both your system and your well.",
