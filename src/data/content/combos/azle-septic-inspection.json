  "localRelevance": "Azle's lakeside real estate market makes pre-purchase inspections essential. Properties near Eagle Mountain Lake carry heightened environmental responsibility, and an inspection evaluates whether the system adequately protects water quality given the sandy loam's rapid percolation. Buyers investing in lakeside homes need assurance that the septic system will not create water quality or compliance issues. The mix of older lakeside cabins and modern homes in Azle means inspectors encounter systems ranging from basic decades-old installations to advanced modern treatment units. Older systems may lack adequate capacity for full-time residential use if they were originally designed for weekend getaway use. Fix Septic Now provides inspections adapted to each Azle property's specific characteristics.",
