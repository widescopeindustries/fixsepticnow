  "heroDescription": "Fix Septic Now provides dependable septic pumping for Seguin homeowners and businesses across Guadalupe County. Seguin's mixed blackland clay and sandy loam soil creates variable drainage conditions that require consistent septic maintenance. Some properties benefit from sandy loam's better drainage, while others contend with tight clay that limits absorption. Regular pumping ensures your tank handles these conditions by keeping solids safely contained regardless of your specific soil type. Our vacuum trucks serve the entire Seguin area, from the pecan-lined streets near downtown to the growing neighborhoods along Highway 90 and the properties along the Guadalupe River. Available 24/7 for scheduled and emergency service. Call Fix Septic Now at (936) 292-2926.",
  "localRelevance": "Seguin's location at the boundary between the Blackland Prairie and the Post Oak Belt gives the community a unique mix of soil types. Properties on the north and west sides of town tend toward denser blackland clay, while areas to the south and east often feature lighter sandy loam. Many Seguin properties contain both soil types on the same lot. This variability means your neighbor's septic experience may differ from yours, and pumping schedules should be tailored to your specific conditions. The Guadalupe River flows through Seguin and represents the primary surface water resource for the community. Septic systems near the river corridor have heightened responsibility for proper maintenance to prevent contamination. Regular pumping reduces the risk of solids escaping into drain fields and eventually reaching the river through either direct runoff or groundwater movement. Seguin's economy has diversified and grown, bringing new residents and housing developments to the area. Many newer homes are on septic systems that will need their first pump-out in the coming years. Meanwhile, historic properties in Seguin's established neighborhoods may have aging tanks that require more frequent service. Fix Septic Now serves the full range of Seguin properties with professional septic pumping throughout Guadalupe County.",

    {
      "question": "Does Seguin's mixed soil affect pumping frequency?",
      "answer": "Yes. Properties on heavier blackland clay should pump every three to four years because the clay drains slowly and provides less drain field margin. Properties on sandy loam may extend to four to five years. Your specific soil type, household size, and system age all factor into the recommended schedule."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the Guadalupe River matter for Seguin septic maintenance?",
      "answer": "The Guadalupe River is Seguin's primary water resource and recreation feature. Septic contamination from poorly maintained systems can reach the river through groundwater or surface runoff. Regular pumping keeps waste contained in your tank and protects the waterway that the community values for drinking water, irrigation, and recreation."
